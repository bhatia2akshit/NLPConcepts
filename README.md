# Common Used algorithms in NLP 

Here I have implemented several commonly used algorithms in Natural Language Processing.

## CKY Parser

This algorithm is responsible for recognising the parsed tree for a particular sentence.

## Deduplication

For detecting Plagarism, I have implemented LSH(Locally Sensitive Hashing). 
MinHashing is used to convert the large documents into small signatures so that memory can be free.
Shingling is form of tokenisation. Jaccard Similarity is used in the first algorithm, that tells how similar are the two documents. 

## Edit Distance: Levenstein Distance

Levenstein Distance is implemented here to detect how far is the word1 from word2.

## Hidden Markov Models

2 algorithms are here. Viterbi is used to detect the hidden states given the observation sequence and parameters of HMM.
Second algorithm is sort of Forward Backward algorithm is used to learn the parameters of HMM.

## Naive Bayes

This algorithm is used to   classify the documents into predefined classes.
