crude	EX-ARCO <ARC> CHIEF SEES ENERGY CRISIS BY 1990 Dwindling global crude oil reserves and the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said. "It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," Anderson told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. "I believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find." Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about 4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear. "If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle East," he said. "We're soon going to be right back where we were in 1973 and 1979." Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb. "There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't enough supply," he said. "There have been no major oil discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years." Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said. Reuter
ship	FERRY DISASTER CLAIMS COULD TOP 30 MLN STG U.K. Insurers could face more than 30 mln stg of insurance claims following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, a spokesman for Lloyds of London said. It could take weeks before the extent of the compensation claims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also before it was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged, said David Larner of Lloyds. The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprise were valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by Townsend Thoresen's parent company Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc <PORL.L>. The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with Lloyds and various other companies, Larner said. Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the Standard Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of several shipowners' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were also underwritten by Lloyds and other companies. Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to total at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and the normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974 of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death. Shipping sources said, however, that these claims could soar if a court found there was negligence or design faults involved. Larner said estimates of compensation claims "were pure guess work" at this time. But if the ship could not be salvaged, the claims would total at least 30 mln stg. Shares of insurances on the London stock exchange fell across the board in a generally weak market. General Accident fell 21p to 936, Royal Insurance dropped 18p to 966 and Prudential fell 9p to 888. P and O shares stood at a late 616, 27p lower on the day. REUTER
crude	TEXACO <TX> SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED Texaco Inc has re-established some key oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations. "Several companies say they are willing to start trading," Yates told Reuters in an interview. The company last week had stated that a number of domestic and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether. Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings. Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and other banks told Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and J.P. Morgan Co's <JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits to cover transactions, it said. The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984. The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case. "Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they could," Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting supplies. "It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an avalanche," he said. "Supplies were cut to the point where we could not run the system at anywhere near capacity." He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton said. It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company, canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas, Occidental Petroleum Co <OXY> demanded cash for crude, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC> asked for special safeguards. The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC <BP> last week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today said, "a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on supplying. They had cancelled last week." He declined to identify the company. <Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said. But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the Algerians, he added. Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter 11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines and oil supplies that are key to the company's business. "It will be business as usual for Texaco," said Martin Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer and Traub. "Creditors are a nervous bunch of people," he said. "But when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company." But other officials at Texaco were not immediately available to say whether discussions were being held with its banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished. Reuter

Congressional officials said the report, received by House Speaker Jim Wright and Senate majority leader Robert Byrd, will not be made public. Congress has demanded a detailed security plan on how U.S. warships and servicemen would be protected from possible attack in the Gulf region, scene of the prolonged war between Iran and Iraq. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration intended to push ahead with the plan despite strong opposition in Congress.

Fitzwater did not say when this might be, but denied the protection plan was being held up. Reuter
crude, ship	U.S., AT U.N., CLAIMS SELF-DEFENSE FOR GULF ATTACK The United States invoked the right of self-defense in destroying an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf, the American delegation told the United Nations. Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci, the delegate of Italy, and Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq. In his explanation, Walters said the United States took defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against American ships in the Gulf. He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle City. Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes. "In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations (Charter), I wish, on behalf of my government, to report that United States forces have exercised the inherent right of self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action in response to attacks by . . . Iran against United States vessels in the Gulf," Walters said.

U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise. The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private group, also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques. It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption. It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports. Reuter

In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to be identified said.

The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon last week and will be effective today, he said.

Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of consumption. He said the Saudis reported they would no longer accept letters of credit from the Bank of Brazil or even from Saudi banks and that Brazil would have to obtain credit guarantees from leading international banks. In February, Brazil had contracted to buy 125,000 bpd from the Saudis until June. Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship...I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere," Santana added. Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. The Saudis had put similar conditions on a previous shipment, he added.

"The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production," he said. "The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market," he added. OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed. Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was ADNOC's most difficult ever but "a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment." He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.

They said last week's cereals management committee agreed to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23. However, it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later. The British government had applied for the release of a further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British intervention stores to prevent market prices rising. However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review the market situation nearer the time before giving its approval. The Commission was given new powers last year to control the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the sources noted. Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes, depending on the state of the market.

"We have the capacity to produce the amount," Rastam Hadi, Petronas's Vice-President for Upstream Sector said. The government will announce its decision on Friday when it unveils the country's budget. Malaysia raised output this month to current levels from 420,000 bpd after reviewing the world oil market. In May, Malaysia cut output to 420,000 bpd from 459,000 in response to a call by OPEC to boost prices. REUTER

In testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, Baker outlined many of the measures taken designed to achieve more balanced growth and a reduction of trade imbalances during the Paris meeting. "These measures should also foster greater stability of exchange rates around current levels," he said. Baker reiterated that the ministers at the Paris meeting agreed that their currencies were within ranges "broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and that further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects." He added: "In these circumstances, we agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels." Reuter

crude	SAUDIS NOT SEEKING OIL PRICE ABOVE 18 DLRS - MEES Saudi Arabia will not seek to push OPEC oil prices above the current benchmark of 18 dlrs per barrel unless oil demand grows strongly, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said. The Cyprus-based weekly newsletter quoted authoritative Saudi sources as saying the Kingdom's oil price policy would not change "unless and until there is a strong revival in the growth of demand for oil." MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi price hawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources. The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on the long-term need to restore the competitive position of oil in general and OPEC oil in particular against other energy sources. "Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with its OPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint to maintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level," MEES said. The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeks of April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd). Output would fall in the last week, causing the month's average to be below quota, MEES said. MEES estimated overall OPEC production for April at around 16.8-16.9 mln bpd -- two mln bpd more than both its figures for March and Reuter estimates for March. It said Iranian production had risen by 500,000 bpd this month to 2.2-2.3 mln bpd, around its quota level. In Iraq, with an OPEC-assigned quota of 1.466 mln bpd, output rose this month to two mln bpd, not including "war relief" supplies from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the newsletter said. Nigeria, which has had problems selling its full 1.238 mln bpd entitlement, increased its output to 1.2 mln bpd, it added. REUTER
crude	CRUDE OIL NETBACKS UP IN U.S., MEDITERRANEAN Crude oil netback values in complex refineries rose slightly in the U.S. and the Mediterranean last Friday from the previous week but were lower elsewhere, according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline. The soft tone to refining margins reflects large worldwide stocks of petroleum products and thin trading activity, traders said. In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by as much as 26 cts a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, an increase of 1.4 pct from the previous Friday, while sour crudes, such as Alaska North Slope, were up one pct. In the Mediterranean, netback values were up 17 cts to 22 cts a barrel, with Arab Light up 17 cts a barrel to 18.62 dlrs, a 0.9 pct increase from the previous Friday and Urals were up 22 cts a barrel to 19.16 dlrs, a 1.2 pct increase. But netbacks for crude oil refined in Northern Europe was generally lower with Brent valued at 18.89 dlrs, off 30 cts from the previous friday, and Bonny Light was off 17 cts to 19.58 dlrs a barrel. Refinery netbacks in Singapore were also lower, with heavier and sour crudes weakest. Arab Heavy dropped 10 cts to 16.63 dlrs a barrel and Dubai was off 12 cts to 18.09 dlrs. On the U.S. West Coast, however, netback values for ANS CIF L.A. were weaker with weak gasoline prices sending the yield at cracking plants down 68 cts to 18.42 dlrs from the previous Friday, as shown below in dlrs a barrel.

crude	LOWER REFINERY OPERATIONS SEEN PRODUCING PROFITS U.S. refiners will have to reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting here. "If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of petroluem products at Conoco Inc "If not, the industry will have a tough 1987," he added. Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said that U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity, with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week ended March 20. The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2 mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7 mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the API said. Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp <CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings. "The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it continues," said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of refining and marketing at <Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S. subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France. Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given the current level of demand but the operating level should increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter, Buckler said. Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S. refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude per day. "I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries over the next five years," he said, adding that these facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude. Reuter

In a summary of its Weather and Crop Bulletin, the agency said scattered showers continued throughout Transvaal, but dry pockets persisted in the northeast and south. Temperatures average one to four degrees C above normal throughout all grain areas, stressing grain-filling corn in areas receiving lightest rainfall, it said. The agency said rainfall during February was near to above normal in most areas, but earlier periods of hot, dry weather reduced yield prospects in parts of the northern Transvaal and southern Orange Free State.

Japanese companies requested a ratio of 80 pct Arab Heavy to 20 pct Arab Light under a term contract agreement with Aramco for 100,000 barrels per day, the sources said. The contractual ratio is 30 pct heavy crude to 70 pct light.

interest, money-fx	GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS Remarks by central bankers raised some hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a move in the near term, money market dealers said. Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact. Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said. Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment this week dashed some hopes of lower rates. The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80 pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market, as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired. But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions, and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to 3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels. The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday. Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than the more public adjustment of leading rates. The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself. Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the 15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds. Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week. This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited with banks. Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5 billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday. Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the estimated 51 billion required for all of April. REUTER
crude	BP SCOTTISH REFINERY SET TO RESTART THIS WEEK The British Petroleum <BP.L> Co Plc's refinery at Grangemouth, Scotland, shut down after an explosion and fire in the hydrocracker on March 22, will probably be back in operation towards the week-end, a refinery spokesman said. He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500 barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January, will not be completed before the end of April. He said the refinery had been closed for longer than originally expected due to the lengthy safety checks being carried out prior to restarting. The explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be out of operation for several months. The remainder of the refinery, including the 19,000 catalytic cracker, was undamaged. He said inquiries into the accident, which happened while the hydrocracker was not in operation, were continuing. In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13. REUTER

He told al-Riyadh newspaper, "Saudi Arabia follows a balanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease in prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and find alternative sources (for energy)." OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system aimed to stabilize the market around 18 dlrs a barrel. OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it will review its current oil price and production policy. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil prices to remain stable for the next two years. Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and production pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of 15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs a barrel average. REUTER

President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying. "We have to study this more," Reagan said. "This is why we increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do more," he said. Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production. However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures. The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It suggested options for the administration to consider, but made no specific recommendations. Reuter

But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a resolution on a common currency exchange rate system. The UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank governors for further discussion. He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia. Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to discuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a new system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year. The denominator approved by the governors has not been made public, but banking sources said it could be similar to the European Monetary System (EMS). Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state. They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms. He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods containing radiation caused by last year's Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union, and agreed all products with excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin.

Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money market from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum credit amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling. "The recent introduction of three-month money and these new regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market and the discount rate as monetary instruments," Kullberg said. Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs, they said. "The central bank for the first time has an instrument with which it really can influence the price of money in this country," one banker said. Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now introduced if the limit is exceeded. Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland's monetary department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy on the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs. "We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the first, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think we will issue at least a few times a week," Korkman told Reuters. He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a three-month maturity at first as the market was best developed for paper of that maturity. The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-month credits and deposits at rates determined by the central bank and the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditional overnight call money market. Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around nine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week, while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion. On the interbank market there has been an increasing trade in banks' CDs, estimated to be some eight billion markka. In addition, commercial paper accounts for around five billion markka and Treasury Bills two billion. REUTER

The bank also cut its seven-day repossession rate to 8-1/2 pct from 8-3/4 pct. The intervention rate has stood at eight pct since it was raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 as the French franc came under pressure ahead of the EMS realignment on January 11. The bank said the purchase, effective tomorrow, is for five pct of private paper and fixed rate Treasury bills maturing between March 25 and June 25 and of other Treasury bills maturing between March 25, 1987 and March 25, 1989. The rate cut had been expected since the bank announced a money market intervention tender earlier today. Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for a quarter percentage point cut, reflecting an easing in the call money rate last week, and the French franc's steadiness on foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada.

Lyng plans to spend "about five minutes" reviewing the status of farm legislation on Capitol Hill before the Economic Policy Council, which is responsible for guiding the administration's economic policy, the aide said. The USDA secretary met this morning with members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, but the handful of lawmakers present did not ask whether the administration intended to offer Moscow a wheat export bonus, the aide said.

The official, speaking from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, said up to 30,000 of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike. He said the others had returned to work over the last week, accepting pay offers of 120 pct from four private companies and from the Frota Nacional de Petroleiros (Fronape), part of the state-owned oil company Petrobras. The association grouping private shipowners, Syndarma, has also offered 120 pct but talks have so far been deadlocked over payment for overtime. The union official said he believed this issue would be resolved shortly. Reuter

crude	OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said. "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again," he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems. "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens," Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd." Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output. "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production. "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production," he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

grain, wheat	PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview. No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said. Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable. The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops. Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds. The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said. Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's yield of 14.0 mln. He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly. The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual population growth rate of more than three pct. Current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes. The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said. This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a "strategic reserve" target of two mln tonnes. Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said. The government wants to keep an extra "safety margin" until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well, he said. The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo. Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply. Aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills. The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said. Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30. Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran. Reuter

dlr, money-fx	NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza," he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg," said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

Foreign exchange reserves rose 3.30 billion francs to 33.94 billion. Sight deposits are a major indicator of money market liquidity in Switzerland. The National Bank said banks paid back 5.5 billion francs of central bank credit taken out at the end of February for the end-month liquidity requirement. This drain was offset in part by new currency swaps, which had the effect of increasing the National Bank's foreign exchange holdings. Bank notes in circulation fell 309.1 mln francs to 24.49 billion, and other deposits on call -- basically government funds -- rose 1.06 billion to 2.10 billion. REUTER

The Bank of Japan here declined comment. The Bank of England was also rumored to be buying dollars against the yen this morning but it also declined comment. Dealers said the intervention halted a sudden late morning drop to a low of 148.65 yen, holding the dollar steady until midsession at about 148.80. The Bank of England was strongly rumored to have intervened on behalf of the dollar against the yen yesterday, but it gave no confirmation. Overnight reports from Tokyo said that the Bank of Japan was aggressively supporting the dollar, but failed to push it back to the perceived target level of 150 yen.

money-fx	CHICAGO FUTURES LEADER SAYS MARKETS CAN ADAPT Foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band, said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's, CME, executive committee. "The target zone would not affect our market I think at all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy market," Melamed told Reuters in an interview. "We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a four pct shift," he said, referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early 1970s. "One thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value." As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial to the Chicago exchange. Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations. "They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it's unrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary." The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so-called "triple-witching" day. "We think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change in the structure as of next June," when the move is scheduled to go into effect, he said. Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading. Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups. The changes "will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace. That's going to prove very, very instrumental in increasing volume over time," he said, predicting the increase would come within a year. Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit on the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program. The CME also received "many negative comments, many more than we anticipated," Melamed conceded. Many futures commission merchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event the price approached the bottom limit. Reuter

crude, nat-gas	SOVIET SAYS DATA SHARING WILL HELP FIND OIL A Soviet geologist said scientists need to coordinate data about onshore and offshore oil deposits to help identify global formations that would indicate other potential discoveries of oil and gas reserves. Vladmir Vladiminovich Semenovich, the head of petroleum geology at Moscow State University, told delegates at the World Petroleum Congress that exploration efficiency could also be improved through new and more sophisticated technology. "We should emphasize that when having the data about petroleum distribution onshore and offshore, it is possible to clarify the idea of global regularities in oil and gas prospects," Semenovich said. "However, much work should be done to coordinate data concerning the structure and oil and gas prospects in adjoining onshore and offshore basins." Sharing the information could help geologists better predict regional trends and underground formations that indicate the presence of oil or gas, he said. Semenovich also said that existing estimates of the potential oil and natural gas resources of the world may need to be revised upward as oil companies continue to examine unexplored regions. The world, which has already produced 476 billion barrels of oil and gas, has a current total of about 733 billion barrels in proved reserves. Undiscovered resources are estimated at about 1.4 trillion barrels, or about half of the total ultimate reserves, Semenovich said. "There are a lot of unstudied regions all over the world and, as far as the already known basins, one continues to find additional reserves," he said, noting that Antarctica has been virtually ignored. "The existing estimate of potential resources of the world may need to be enlarged." To find deeper and more expensive reserves, scientists will need to use 3-D mapping of underground formations and laser spectrometry to measure bitumen in soils and plants among other techniques, he said. He estimated that continental slopes contain about 10 to 13 pct of all offshore reserves. Semenovich also said that virtually all of the total oil and gas resources now estimated to exist in the world would be discovered and placed in production during the next 50 years. After his speech, Semenovich told Reuters that Soviet oil production was increasing. "The difficulties of 1985 have been overcome and we're now back to normal production," he said. The Soviet Union, the world's largest producer of oil, had experienced drilling and technical problems that cut total liquids production from 12.45 mln barrels a day in 1984 to 12.1 mln barrels a day in 1985. Last year, the Soviets produced an estimated 12.3 mln barrels. When asked about the recent reopening and testing of a coal gasification project in Soviet Central Asia, Semenovich said the project was important because of the lack of oil reserves in the region. Semenovich declined to identify at what level of world oil prices the coal gasification process would become economic again. "It's too expensive for the time being," Semenovich said. "Theoretical development is underway and tests are being run. For the moment, coal gasification is a very small part of the energy industry," he said. Reuter

money-fx	TAIWAN TO STUDY SUSPENDING FOREX CONTROLS Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financial officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls, a cabinet statement said. The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy and Central Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduce Taiwan's surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached a record 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month. Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministry and the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to ease the controls, but he did not give details. Yu said the government could maintain the framework of the foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. The controls would be used during emergency. Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its trade surplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion in 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's trade with the United States, according to official figures. But he said that while easing the controls would help reduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a short time. Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from growing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largest trading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports. Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, told Reuters: "The decision came a little bit late. But it was better than never." Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, said the government should rapidly relax its foreign exchange controls and open its market wider to help balance trade with its trading partners, especially the United States. "The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchange controls will not only help our trading partners, but also help our own economic problems," he said. He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boost Taiwan's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February. REUTER

It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap facilities, dealers said.

crude	U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL The United States' dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s, according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates. Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977. "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990. "However, the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction," Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices. "An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy.

The vote in favor was despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region. In the Senate, a leading Republican senator, former Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark Hatfield of Oregon, said he would try to prevent consideration of the bill. He said he will put a so-called "hold" on the bill until he finds out whether the War Powers Act applies to protecting Kuwaiti tankers. Congressional leaders complain they were not consulted about plans to put the U.S. flag on Kuwaiti ships and some charged the policy could lead the U.S. into the Iran-Iraq war.

Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament. He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation which began in late 1983. Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil, slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln. January-September figures released at the weekend showed Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467 mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million. Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.

But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its war-battered economy now more than ever before. "We expect a common effort between the central bank and Arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed," he said. Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and budget deficits. Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in reducing demand for imports and increasing exports. "These are encouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet," he said. "We believe that with a just political solution acceptable to all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit the Lebanese pound and Lebanon." In the meantime, he said the central bank had four main goals: 1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit 2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bank financing institutions in financing the deficit 3) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreign currency deposits 4) to protect the financial health of commercial banks.

interest, money-fx	PARIS G-6 MEET SET NO TARGETS - LEIGH-PEMBERTON Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading industrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets. Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee that "we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding" on how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their current levels. He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint currency float - but one which let it still purse an independent monetary policy. "I would concede that, since the Louvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something," Leigh-Pemberton said. "The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together" towards stabilising exchange rates," Leigh-Pemberton said. He did not mention this week's intervention by central banks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test the accord. Leigh-Pemberton said that "the effectiveness of this (cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in the pre-Plaza days" before September 1985. He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing." He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing." Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank of England favoured full EMS membership for sterling, provided such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates lower, he said "the two half point cuts (this month in banks' base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now." Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a "cautious step-by-step approach" to reducing short term interest rates, not least because "we have a potential problem with inflation." Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, "one of the highest" among industrialised nations, he added. Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget on March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10 pct. Regarding sterling's relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall. He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterling index, when compared with the index's level before oil prices dropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975, closed here today at 72.1, unchanged from the previous close. Reuter

crude	OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices, analysts said. "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales," Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally." He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr. OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. "The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result," Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short. Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986.

crude, ship	GREECE SCRAPS U.S. BASE CLOSURE REQUEST Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil rights in the Aegean eased. A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential clash. Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday. The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had prompted it to make the request were no longer valid. Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its national interests are threatened. The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean. Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled. Athens says it considers the accord inactive. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined comment on the statement. Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row. REUTER

Processors dropped spot Chicago corn basis bids three cents after covering most of the April needs this week, with river corn basis bids following CIF Gulf corn values lower.

crude	US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS U.S. military planners ruled out Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said. U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a "measured and appropriate response" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters. Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at home and in the Gulf. "It simply demonstrated the United States will take military action when they (Iran) take military action," Norman Polmar, a defense analyst and author, said. He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack. In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack. Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a Security Council call for a ceasefire. "We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any chance at all," he said, adding that the action made it clear tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping. In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the lower Gulf. "We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting capabilities," Cordesman said. He predicted the United States would respond to any future major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, "but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures."

In a field report, the officer said indications were that winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared with 38,000 last year. He said the damage was probably more limited in southern and central regions and most widespread in the north. Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where little or no snow cover was present, he added. The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well developed plants and for winter barley. Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing water occurred in the fields. The officer said repairing damage will probably call for special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and where stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added. Reuter

Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association reported to the U.S. official.

An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from July-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said. Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said. Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier estimates of 150,000, the official said.

At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said. He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable. Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental. "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said. The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said. It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said. Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable. He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement. Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks. The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago. REUTER

"The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18 dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings distributed into national production levels. "The conference noted that all market indicators, including spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement." "The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the second half of the year and decided that in order to secure continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into the same national production levels as were defined by the above-mentioned agreement for that quarter." "Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices in order to secure price stability around the opec price structure. "Should there be any significant change in market prices, the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the year, which would secure the desired market stability." "The conference reiterated the necessity of member countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December 1986, both in terms of official price, and national production, levels. "For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the terms of the agreement." "Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market stability. The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group of five heads of delegation established by the 77th (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.

The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a case for damages should not be allowed after such a long interval. Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel, whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mln marks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts. The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of over one billion marks stunned West Germany's business community, and led to a tightening of banking regulations. The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marks announced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud in currency transactions. Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when it collapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in 1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bank were jailed in 1983. But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he produced medical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution during his childhood, which might have led him to take his own life. Reuter

Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc <TX.N> and a Mexican and an Argentine firm. President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports for four months due to the quake. Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of Ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a 180-day period.

The planes "dealt accurate and effective blows to both maritime targets before they returned safely to base," a military spokesman told the Iraqi new agency INA. There was no immediate confirmation of the attacks from Persian Gulf shipping sources. The last confirmed Iraqi attack on shipping was on March 8, when an Iranian tanker was hit by a missile south of Iran's Kharg island oil export terminal. Gulf shipping sources yesterday reported an Iranian warship had set the Cypriot supertanker Pivot on fire with a missile. They said there were no injuries on board and the ship headed for the Gulf Emirate of Fujairah under its own power after the fire was put out. The Pivot was the 18th ship hit this year in the maritime extension of the 6-1/2 year-old Iran-Iraq war. Reuter

They estimated that the bulk of liquidity was added at about 3.95 pct. Call money fell to 3.90/4.0 pct after the move. It had been 3.80/90 on Friday. The move came as call money extended a rise begun Friday after the Bundesbank took up some six billion marks owed to it by other European central banks after currency interventions in the framework of European Monetary System in January. Rates could ease further in trading today but dealers expect them to rise later in the week as banks begin paying out funds for tax payments on behalf of clients. Some 30 billion marks is likely to leave the market this month, with the bulk being paid out next week. In anticipation of this liquidity drain, banks have stocked up reserves at the Bundesbank. On Thursday, minimum reserve holdings declined to 57.0 billion marks from 60.0 billion on Wednesday but were well above the 53.2 billion held on Tuesday. Daily average reserve holdings rose slightly to 54.7 billion marks from 54.5 billion. The daily average reserve holdings were above the level of around 51 billion marks dealers said is needed for the required daily average for the month. With the heavy tax drain in March, banks are likely to remain cautious about taking more liquidity out of reserves than is absolutely necessary. However, a new securities repurchase pact likely to be added next week to replace a facility expiring then could somewhat offset the drain. The Bundesbank is expected to allocate more than the 3.4 billion marks which is due to be rolled over, dealers said. REUTER
crude	NIPPON MINING PLANS MORE U.S. JOINT VENTURES Nippon Mining Co Ltd president Yukio Kasahara said the state-owned Japanese firm hoped to find additional joint venture partners to explore for U.S. oil reserves. "We have to secure the stability of oil for Japan," Kasahara told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. "In the exploration area I think Japanese companies are interested in joint ventures." Nippon Mining, for example, last September signed an agreement with Dupont Co's <DD> Conoco Inc to participate in a 135 mln dlr exploration venture that includes six wells on land and 14 offshore Louisiana. The first joint well drilled is in the Gulf of Mexico's Green Canyon Block 182, a deepwater lease that Conoco was almost forced to return to the federal government undrilled because of low oil prices. "At this moment we have no success but we will proceed with Conoco. Maybe by the end of the year we will find oil there," Kasahara said. He said that similar kinds of joint ventures "would be best" for Nippon Mining's oil exploration efforts in the future. Kasahara also said Nippon Mining was not planning to acquire any U.S. refining or marketing outlets. "Retail sales in general do not interest the Japanese oil companies," he said. When asked whether he believed world oil prices might strengthen later this year, Kasahara said he expected prices to hold steady at today's level. "Within this year I think the 18 dlrs a barrel will continue. But next year I don't know," he said. "For the refining business, stability is important. Whether the price is 18 dlrs or 20 dlrs, we don't care." But encouraging additional upstream efforts may require modestly higher oil prices, Kasahara added. "For exploration I think 20 dlrs a barrel or 22 dlrs a barrel would be reasonable," he said. The key factor in determining whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would raise its 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price is the ongoing war between Iran and Iraq, Kasahara said. Saudi Arabia, he added, was an uncertain element in the OPEC equation because of its need to maintain revenues at the same time the weakened U.S. dollar has reduced oil profits. Nippon Mining, which like all Japanese crude buyers is benefitting from the drop in the value of the dollar, favors continuing to price OPEC crude oil according to U.S. currency regardless of the dollar-yen relationship, Kasahara said. "I hope the dollar would strengthen eventually and continue to improve. I would prefer to see the (OPEC) pricing remain in dollars," he said. Reuter

crude	ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

The decision followed yesterday's ruling by an Amsterdam court preventing the sector's employers continuing with current plans for 350 redundancies this year until the court sits again on May 7, Rosenmuller told a meeting of the general cargo sector's 4,000 workers today. The court ruled the employers had made a mistake in the complicated legal procedure for obtaining official permission for the redundancies, and therefore could not proceed. "There is no need to continue the strikes for the moment now the immediate pressure of redundancies has been lifted," Rosenmuller said. But he added that the strikes, which began on January 19 in protest against plans for 800 redundancies by 1990, could resume at any time before May 7 if the employers made any moves to re-apply for permission for the redundancies. SVZ labour relations manager Gerrard Zeebregts said they would be meeting their lawyers today with a view to re-applying for this permission next week in the hope of gaining approval for the redundancies within a month.

They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline at 150 mln dlrs. "the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is gigantic," president leon febres cordero said after inspecting the damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 miles from here. The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the presidential press office. The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific ocean port. Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of ecuador's exports. the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo province, health minister jorge brancho told reuters. "we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is no way of now knowing the exact figure because many people have disappeared," he said. Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead.

ship	TAIWAN SHIPBUILDER LOOKS FOR JAPANESE VENTURES Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim its debts, chairman Louis Lo said. He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint production venture, to build two hulls for <Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T>, he said. Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi, which would complete production. "We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said. He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea. Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs. But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery. "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification," he said. Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87. CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said. Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship repairing was bright. REUTER

crude	CHINESE OFFICIALS SAY DRILLING OUTLOOK BRIGHT China's oil drilling industry is one of the few bright spots in the international oilpatch with about 1,000 rigs currently working and annual increases of 80-100 expected through the end of the century, a Chinese petroleum official said. "In China, production concentrates on the domestic market, and does not depend on the international price of oil," Zhai Guang Ming, a director of the Chinese Ministry of Petroleum, told Reuters. Chinese oil sold within the nation's borders is priced at about one-third the 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price established by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Zhai said in an interview at the World Petroleum Congress. The optimism in China is in sharp contrast to the United States where weak oil prices have prompted a steep fall in the number of active rigs from a 1981 peak of 4,500 to only 765 last week according to the latest Baker Hughes Co rig count. At this time, China actually has more rigs in operation than any other country in the world, said Xianglin Hou, another member of the 20-man Chinese delegation at the Houston meeting. But this does not mean good news for the sagging oilfield equipment industry in the rest of the world, said Bryan Walman, international sales manager for Reed Tool Co in Houston. Walman said more than 90 pct of China's drilling activity is on land and under the control of the Chinese government which requires local manufacture of drilling equipment. But U.S. and other western nations do provide equipment for China's fledgling offshore projects as well as participate in the actual drilling, he said. Amoco Corp <AN>, for example, has reported a discovery in 1,000 feet of water in the South China Sea. "We're encouraged," said Alfred Munk, manager of Amoco's foreign affairs, "but we need substantial reserves before we can do commercial production in a remote area like that." Zhai estimated that current Chinese oil production of 130 mln tonnes a year should rise to total 200 mln tonnes annually by the year 2,000. Chinese crude reserves total 23.6 billion barrels, with ultimate resources estimated at 69.3 billion barrels. Reuter

money-fx	U.S. TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE The departure of James Baker's closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will not change the course of Washington's domestic and international economic policies, U.S. officials said. Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation. U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in shepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through the U.S. Congress. But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure, to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers, signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury Secretary himself might leave soon. "It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it came up," one official said. Another commented, "Baker will miss him, but he's not going to stand in his way." There has been widespread speculation since last autumn that Darman sought a Wall Street job. Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out. Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed. "Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss," he said. U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be an undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term, at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as "indispensable" to Baker. Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system. But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives. Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council, spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before. Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a political strategist "and that's Baker's strength too," the official said. There were already indications that Baker, who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor. One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould, who holds the number three Treasury position of Under-Secretary. Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years. Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated. He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement, when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain curbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turning point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets. Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth. These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and the United State's massive trade deficit. That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman's departure. REUTER

dlr, money-fx	U.S. BANKER PREDICTS FURTHER DOLLAR FALL THIS YEAR A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels. Kurt Viermetz, Worldwide Treasurer of <Morgan Guaranty Trust Co>, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis. Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab Cambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached last month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar around current levels left many questions unanswered. "I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in the dollar," Viermetz said. "I believe there is room for a further fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987." The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Great Britain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February to stabilise major currencies around current levels. The accord came after months of transatlantic argument, with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington's policy of talking the dollar lower had made life impossible for West German and Japanese exporters. The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued slide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in September 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances. But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty's economic models showed that with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued sluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Trade deficit would improve only temporarily. He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120 billion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160 billion dlrs. "This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities and politicians in Washington," he said. Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should attempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struck when the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen. Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or "Plaza Accord," the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240 yen. Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to see the dollar hold within a "loose range" of 1.75 to 1.90 marks and 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currency lower being countered by central bank intervention. The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen -- its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40 years. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks. Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an uncontrolled fall in the dollar. But at the same time, worries about the international debt crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4 pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world. The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab world and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres. Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on the role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards securitisation of business. Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers Association, said Arab banks have to shake off their old mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on investment banking. REUTER
interest, money-fx	U.K. BASE RATES WILL FALL AGAIN SOON, SAY ANALYSTS Today's modest half-point cut in U.K. Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said. They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant. Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg. Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading. Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year. But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt. Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates. "Today's cut was slightly disappointing," said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. "The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget." Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time. The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term. Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again. "The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being," said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds. "But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long." Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday. Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said "There is another half point to come in the near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks." Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange rate. Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately. Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances of re-election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988. Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial targets. With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's Marshall said "Sterling is simply the best game in town, especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong."

He told a press conference that the growth of Japanese money supply remains high. The bank will have to watch closely various developments resulting from its already eased monetary stance, such as the sharp rise in real estate and stock prices, he said. Although the yen's rise will have a greater deflationary impact on the economy, the economy is not likely to slow down much further, Sumita said. "I don't think we should change our economic outlook at the moment," Sumita said. Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year. The governor said the six major industrial nations are expected to review last month's pact on currency stability when they meet next in April. Dealers said they expect the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. Amd West Germany - to meet just before the IMF/World Bank interim committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9.

crude	QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88 The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices, announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals. The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."

grain, wheat	YUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA There was no evidence of winterkill in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S. Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field report. The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions. However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall's late seeding, it said. Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the report said. Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions, they said. The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it emerged from winter. Reuter
interest, money-fx	FRENCH PRIMARY BOND MARKET SHOWS NEW SPARKLE The French primary bond market is showing signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said. The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5. The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate, the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this week, dealers noted. The Bank of France's "open market" policy to regulate the money markets since December has been based on a floor and ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and seven day repurchase rates. For the moment the sentiment is of "wait and see" on rate cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said. Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of 11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily absorbed. The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12 billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said. Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity in the primary market at the moment despite competition from the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange. There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand - with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees. Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March 9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct. Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said. Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest focussed on the likely three next issues. These will include an expected four to five billion franc issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de Refinancement Hypothecaire.

crude	SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer. Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong. "Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down," Wellemeyer said. "The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again," he said. In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output. Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993. Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the world demand for oil. Reuter

crude	AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said. December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday. "Fundamentals are awful," said Philip Lambert, analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln bpd, little changed from September levels. Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 18.5 mln bpd. The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian, in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war. The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile. Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S. Attack, analysts said. They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said. Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities, analysts said. But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible. Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew, said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response. "The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response. Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory," Pyne said. Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was "a responsible retaliation," with the U.S. Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict. Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however. He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation. The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said. The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger. Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower, analysts and traders said.

crude	U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING U.S. crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session. They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December, have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its highest level since January 1986. OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review. Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises. Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices should begin easing. "OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm," said John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures. OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln barrels in the fourth quarter. This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December. Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran, Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output. "And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price," said Nauman Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy. "The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are committed to stabilizing the market," said Rosario Ilacqua, analyst with L.F. Rothschild. However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions. Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000 barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation. Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines, producers receive less money for their oil. "The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia," said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. "In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting," he said. One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war. "The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf," said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites. Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the U.S. flag, with naval escorts. "Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up," Knuettel said. Reuter

Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry of Agriculture economist said. Reuter
crude	PARIBAS SEEKING TO ADJUST ECUADOR OIL FACILITY Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220 mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports, wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said. But the French bank's plan, which would effectively postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52 members of the loan syndicate. The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair. President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt. Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue. Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job for international financial organizations and not for commercial banks, bankers said. The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in August 1982. Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions for Latin borrowers will be set back. "There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a restructuring would look bad," one banker commented. Reuter

crude	AMOCO <AN> SEES 1ST QTR NET TOPPING 4TH QTR Amoco Corp first quarter profits are expected to exceed the 165 mln dlrs, or 65 cts per share, reported for 1986's fourth quarter, chairman Richard Morrow said. Speaking to reporters after a security analyst meeting, he said the gain was expected because of higher oil and gas prices, but declined to compare his expectations with the 331 mln dlrs, or 1.28 dlrs per share, the company earned in 1986's first quarter. Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco's first quarter refining and marketing results "will look pretty poor," because of low margins in January and February. The margins began to improve last month and look pretty good now, he added. Morrow said he expects oil product margins to remain good for the rest of the year, "but it remains to be seen if they will match 1986 levels." The Amoco chairman said he expects crude oil prices to remain in the 17 to 20 dlr barrel range for the rest of 1988 based on his belief that OPEC's agreement will hold. Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is 21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level would result in a 40 pct increase in oil company exploration spending. President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amoco reduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by a total of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a drop in oil and gas prices. Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that reserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end prices will remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said the drop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from 27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserve estimate by four pct. Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gas liquids production to decline about five pct this year from last year's 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals made last year when oil prices were falling. He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by the purchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels per day to the company's 1987 U.S. production. Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to be increasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-free gasoline, especially the higher octane grades. He said expected federal regulations on gasoline vapor pressure will further tighten the industry's gasoline production capacity. Reuter

crude	KUWAIT SEES OPEC OUTPUT OVER CEILING TO END-YEAR OPEC output for the second half of 1987, including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday, Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said. Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter target. Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, "OPEC third quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd" Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices. Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd, rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September. Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369 mln in the second half. Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. "We will not discuss it. There will not be any change," he said. Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed. "We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet," he said. Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting. Ali said "The problem of differentials is a real one. I would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes." Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said "If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do the work of another minister." Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades. OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes. Reuter
grain, wheat	SHULTZ SAYS U.S. PRODUCTS MUST BE COMPETITIVE Asked what the U.S. State Department's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow, Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders that U.S. products must be competitive in the world market. "If we are going to sell our products, whatever they may be, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market," Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association of Wheat Growers. "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't," he said. "That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets, and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm program and try to figure out what we should do to make it better," Shultz told the Wheat Growers. Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the American housewife, he realizes the importance of American agricultural products being competitively priced. Speculation has been in the market for some time that the United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices. Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if it were competitively priced. Agriculture Department officials have declined to take any official position on the issue. Reuter

crude	U.S. CONSIDERING OIL INDUSTRY TAX INCENTIVES The Reagan Administration is considering tax incentives to boost oil output and restore 100,000 jobs, U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said. A tax credit for new exploration would be part of a package to bring 1,000 idle drilling rigs back into operation and raise domestic production by one mln barrels a day, he said. The tax status of exploration might also be changed, Herrington told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. He said the oil industry was experiencing difficult times internationally and had been devastated in the United States. Consumer demand and a significant decline in domestic production has resulted in a rise in oil imports of one mln barrels a day in over the last 16 months, Herrington said. "Steps must be taken...To reverse the downturn in our domestic energy industry and to safeguard and increase our energy security," he said. The administration is committed to improving marketplace conditions and incentives to spur exploration and development. "This commitment includes rejecting quick fix solutions, like an oil import fee, which are bad for the United States and bad for the world," he added. REUTER
dlr, money-fx	BRAZIL TEMPORARILY LEGALISES DLR PARALLEL MARKET Brazilian President Jose Sarney announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of U.S. dollars in the parallel currency market, aimed at promoting imports of foreign goods. In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face "current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the purchase of goods." The parallel market, although officially tolerated, is technically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above the official rate. Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the parallel market without having to wait for an official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex). Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the economy. The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council (CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's trade policy, with participation of the private sector. The Council had been closed three years ago by the military government of former President Joao Figueiredo. Reuter

In particular, he told an American Stock Exchange conference, a decline in the dollar below current levels would exacerbate financial market conditions. "Trying to artificially depress the dollar severely below current levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditions and lead to further potential for financial problems." Nowhere, Johnson said, are Fed officials hearing that U.S. businesses cannot compete at current exchange rates. He acknowledged the U.S. trade deficit was persisting despite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in the past two years. But the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soon begin showing improvement. "The stage I think is being set for a healthy, constructive expansion without inflationary instability," he said.

The lawsuits would be filed with competent international bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs. The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack, he said. Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday. He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs "except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence." Reacting to Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed, Aqazadeh said: "Iran will also consider the case closed after its retaliatory measure." Iranian officials have said their response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests around the world might come under attack. Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack significantly affecting oil prices. IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the entrance to the Gulf. "If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can either, and this would be to everyone's harm," the radio quoted him as saying. REUTER

Speaking to reporters at the Offshore Technology Conference, Buchanan-Smith said, "No, we've made that absolutely clear, we see no reason for changing (the production level)." Earlier today, Buchanan-Smith gave the go-ahead to Mobil Corp for two new North Sea developments -- the Ness oil field and Beryl B subsea water injection project -- totalling 96 mln dlrs (60 mln British pounds). Unlike Norway, which has restricted its production of North Sea oil by 80,000 barrels a day in an effort to stabilize world oil prices, Britain has consistently refused to intervene in the market place. Buchanan-Smith also said there may be a demand-supply gap in the 1990s for natural gas in Britain, but added that it would probably be less than had been previously estimated. Norway is a major producer of natural gas and this morning Norway's Energy Minister Arne Oien said he was hoping Britain will take more Norwegian gas in the 1990s. Buchanan-Smith also said he expects to announce the results of the 10th licensing round of North Sea tracts next month. He said there had been 75 applications for 127 tracts by 84 companies, and added that he expects about 50 blocks will be licensed.

crude	NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2 pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here. Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field rescue project. Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets. Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all its North Sea fields for the rest of the year. Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth. The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August, field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said. Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence. BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown. Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company said. September production was also sharply higher at the Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said. Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said. Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd in September, compared with 100,188 in August. Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in August. Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on stream a second well, cutting September production to just two days. REUTER
ship	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters. The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said. The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors. The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said. They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment. Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1. The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said. A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said. Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity. This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said. The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said. The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989. Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping. However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said. Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said. The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said. In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said. "World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world," said an official at a major Japanese shipping company. The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said. REUTER
money-fx	SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods. SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan. Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year. In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency. Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers. Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today. With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire. Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's economic performance. The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears. This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments. Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said. Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF representative had told him the fund's executive board was "very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months." The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more. Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30. REUTER

Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached. The additional output would be related to plans now under discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake. Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified part of Ecuador's export commitments. But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of 300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico might supply Ecuador's South Korean market. Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao. REUTER

They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor. Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher, left in a major oil industry shake up last December. The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the post permanently. The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil market. The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20 years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut. Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel last December. Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia does business, the sources said. The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi, Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic Port. REUTER

Officials of the foreign ministry said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980.

money-fx	TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS The Louvre accord on currency stability, which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since last February, appeared in serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to the boil, foreign exchange dealers said. But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates. "That's not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington," Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact. Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S. Agreed to stop talking the dollar down. However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord. "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currency analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said. But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine view, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on." French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for "a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit." Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury commented on the row. But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre Accord." In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S. Was still committed to the accord. In a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also stepped into the French money market to hold down rates, injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose close to eight pct. Reuter

money-fx	U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says. Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller, who joined the board last August. He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the volatility of exchange rates. Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation. His idea, which many conservative economists find appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan. It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation, key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly. Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base. "What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes," says Heller. In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies. A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa. The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early 1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world. But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the monetary system, is also being widely questioned. Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also. For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy. Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement. The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems. Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters. He appears convinced that officials from West Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing. The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates. As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis. "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary policy might be eased," he says. He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis. Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and traded on a world-wide basis, so "that an index has a relevance for the entire world," he says. In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes. "Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures, the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions," he says. However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system. He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities. Reuter
crude	WILDLIFE UNIT PROPOSES ALASKA REFUGE OIL STUDY The National Wildlife Federation rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration. The federation, the nation's largest conservation group, said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called the Interior's research into the effects of development "so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision." Hair called the department's proposal a "reflection of a largely political decision," adding "we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area." Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen. It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration. Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain. Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development. Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct. He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas, fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration. The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years. Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to make a sound judgement. Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil. reuter

crude	KUWAITI DAILY SAYS OPEC CREDIBILITY AT STAKE OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutiny in coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies of oil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabas said. In an article headlined, "Gulf oil sources say Middle East production up 1.4 mln bpd," it warned OPEC's official prices could face fresh pressure from international oil companies seeking cheaper supplies. It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and other producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts. "The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under fresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in the European and American markets," the daily said. The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had in March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some members had raised output last week. It gave no details. "Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and producing over quotas has begun anew," it said. The sources warned that "maybe the (price of a) barrel of oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if there is no control on supplies," it said. "The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure OPEC over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March," it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift from Qatar unless it gave price discounts. "More than one official has warned OPEC would find its solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May," it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer. Reuter

crude	PETRO-CANADA TO DRILL TWO TERRA NOVA TEST WELLS Petro-Canada, Canada's state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland. Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said. Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said. "We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system," Petro-Canada said. The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984. "We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up additional reserves there," the company said. Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said. Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX. Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary office. Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added. Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said. Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query. The company estimates a production system combining both Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said. Reuter
money-fx	GULF ARAB MINISTERS DISCUSS ECONOMIC COOPERATION Finance and economy ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting to discuss further economic integration, officials said. They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank governors on a common currency exchange rate. The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year. The six states have different currency systems. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar. Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by itself. The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket. Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint economic agreements "is increasingly linking the interests of GCC citizens together." The general assembly of the Gulf Investment Corporation met in Abu Dhabi earlier under the chairmanship of Bahrain's Finance and National Economy Minister, Ibrahim Abdul-Karim The corporation was formed to contribute to joint economic and investment projects in the GCC.

interest, money-fx	U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said. For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up. But that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse. "Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it," said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short of further depreciation of the dollar. Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit. The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 33 points to 2339. Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the markets' instability frightening. He believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that "once you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop." "There's a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic." Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and 264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare. "We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But the agony may be fairly drawn out," Marris told Reuters. Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession. The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about. The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen. Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February. Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war. Many economists believe that long-run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the massive budget deficit. But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar. "The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad, at least by Japan," said Lanston's Jones. Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers, Latin American governments and others. But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and Co, scoffed at the notion. "It's ridiculous to think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar weakness," he said. Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit. "We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody cares," he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69 will have been greater. He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year. But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. "Put on your helmets," Giordano said. REUTER
crude	QATAR"S BANKS SET FOR FURTHER LEAN SPELL Bank profits in the Gulf oil state of Qatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks are retrenching further in one of the region"s most overbanked markets. Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit for several foreign banks, although locally-owned operations were in some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing market share. <Qatar National Bank SAQ>"s (QNB) General Manager, Abdulla Khalid al-Attiya, said: "The economy is not improving as we hoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks." Oil-dependent Qatar, with a tiny indigenous population of 60,000 to 80,000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about 280,000, boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bank operations. Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-wide recession, aggravated this year by Qatar"s severe difficulty marketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices, has taken a heavy toll on the economy and bank profitability. As a result, the only U.S. Bank, <Citibank NA>, is thought to be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growing locally based <Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only started operations in 1984, bankers said. Citibank would not comment. Other foreign banks have retrenched, with <Standard Chartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow. <Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit 51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to local business, bankers said. One banker added: "Weak profits are here to stay for the time being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment." Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last year when OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return to fixed prices. However, it soon became apparent that Qatar was having difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices. The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crude prices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have been running in recent weeks at 100,000 and 120,000 barrels per day, well down on the nation"s OPEC quota of 285,000, oil sources said. Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar"s revenue has led to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector to private contractors after a marginal improvement in January. Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profits last year, as did the introduction of minimum reserve requirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing has almost dried up as a traditional source of bank income. Of the local banks, QNB conducts the bulk of the government"s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantage its rivals cannot expect to match, bankers said. The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1 mln Qatari riyals, while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to 9.0 billion, making it by far the largest bank in Qatar. But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridging loans for the public and private sector to tide government departments and local business over the lean economic spell, Attiya said. "Generally speaking, we are overbanked in Qatar," he said, echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community. Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest, <Doha Bank Ltd QSC>, reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to 27.5 mln riyals, while <Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>, registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985. The newcomer Al Ahli Bank, continued to expand rapidly and reported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during the start-up period from August 4, 1984 to end-1985. Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to win commercial deposits previously held by foreign banks, increasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks to reexamine their staffing levels and overheads. <Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branch last year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profit in 1985 of 12,000 riyals. Two other long-established banks in the Gulf, the <British Bank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered, also found last year a difficult climate to make strong profits. BBME"s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in 1985, but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985"s result had been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions. "Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline, while local banks are increasing their market share," Farquharson said. BBME"s operating profit was steady in 1986, edging up to 12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985. "We are expecting the same level of operating profit in 1987," Farquharson said. Standard Chartered"s net profit last year recovered slightly to 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161,000 in 1985. Staff numbers were cut last year to reduce overheads. Bankers said the lack of new construction projects in Qatar means business is unlikely to pick up this year although hopes are rising that the start of Qatari gas exploitation could provide a boost. But the threat of higher U.S. Interest rates may erode bank deposits as savings are moved offshore. REUTER
corn, grain	PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders. Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders. Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done, in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports. As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize. Barreto said, "My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part." He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders. Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator, whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them. "There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system," Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had accepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible. The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

interest, money-fx	BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit, banking economists and money market dealers said. The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future, they said. The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT. But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and did not necessarily herald any policy moves. Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark. Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office, that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter. Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct. "They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or Lombard," Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder, Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany. A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand, with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said. The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve. "The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder," he said. A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month, would have little practical significance, dealers said. The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit. But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere "eyewash." Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit. But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further. "The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further," said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann. Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. "But I don't expect any convincing measures," he said. Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month-end distortions. Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15. Two public holidays that week could also distort the market. Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55 pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact. But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not represent a tightening of policy, however. Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said. On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon. Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French occupation this century. But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes.

corn, grain	SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA Despite earlier optimistic indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage in its development and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct from the previous year. The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts, which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it said. Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan. But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the department said. Reuter

money-fx	PHILADELPHIA EXCHANGE TO EXTEND HOURS FOR ASIA The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets, exchange president Nicholas Giordano said. He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between 1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third quarter this year. The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve clients in the region and educate financial markets about the advantages of currency options, Giordano said. Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the exchange-trade currency option market against existing over-the-counter option trading during the local working day. Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and had grown in popularity, he said. The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs. Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily. Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities, set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries access to a currency option market of much greater depth and liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

"Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the Paris Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic conditions," Baker told a Senate committee. Baker continued, "We said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels." He referred to a February agreement by six leading industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters. Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan and Germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies for the United States to support the dollar. "I will not comment because the foreign exchange market reads more or less than is intended in my statements," Baker said. Baker said that the other signatories recognized that they must carry their share of the load of correcting external imbalances that have hindered the world's economy. He cited news reports that Germany would increase a proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth. Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the Japanese budget was made final. Baker said those nations were stimulating their economies in a manner consistent with gains against inflation. Reuter

The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new "Silkworm" missiles at superpower flags. The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf. "They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil," one of the administration officials, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said. U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S. offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.

crude	INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. "(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports," the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country"s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, "there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves." "This group strongly favours an import substitution economy," the report says. Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. "This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s," the report notes. Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. "For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry." "Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture," the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said. REUTER
crude	ENERGY/HEAVY OILS The oil price collapse of 1986 put development of a vast petroleum resource -- heavy and extra heavy oils -- on hold. But as oil prices increase the long-term economic outlook is favorable, oil industry experts said. "Estimated potential world reserves of extra heavy oils exceed 500 billion barrels, of which more than half are located in Venezuela," Juan Chacin Guzman, President of Petroleos de Venezuela told the World Petroleum Congress. "And this virtually unused resource represents a prime example of the need to invest in technology to ensure tomorrow's energy future," he added. Venezuela had to reduce heavy crude oil output in favor of light oils because of economics and a very limited market. Not many refineries have been upgraded to process the heavy oils. "Improved technology has the potential for reducing the capital investment and operating costs of typical heavy oil development projects by 30 pct or more," Gordon Willmon, VP and general manager, oil sands and coal department, Esso Resources Canada Ltd said at the World Petroleum Congress. Crude oil prices fell under 10 dlrs dlrs a barrel last summer as OPEC members increased production to gain market share, but have since risen to around 18 dlrs because the OPEC production/pricing agreement is basically in tact. Willmon said light and medium crude oils currently supply 90 pct of world oil demand yet they account for less than 25 pct of remaining petroleum resources. "So future demand increasingly will be met from the various forms of heavy oil," Willmon said. Heavy crude oil resources include extra-heavy oil/tar sand, natural bituminous sands and oil shales (in sedimentary rock). Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oil development economical, including real and stable growth in crude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improved technology. He said he expects "all pieces of the puzzle to fit together." But he cautioned that the short-term outlook is very sensitive to crude oil prices. And he said the most important factor in development of heavy oils is the recovery of the price of crude. Willmon said the price of light crude must be about eight dlrs higher than heavy crude before there is an incentive for an oil company to upgrade its refinery to process heavy oil. He said the current price differential is only about five dlrs a barrel. Willmon indicated that a benchmark crude oil price above 20 dlrs would be ideal. But he said currently under study are a broad range of high potential cost-effective technologies for resources recovery, transportation and upgrading of heavy oils, which would permit commercial development despite a lower crude oil price outlook. Willmon said these technologies included enhanced recovery by steam injection and oil-and-water emulsion to reduce the viscocity of the heavy oils so they can flow easily through a pipeline. He said such technologies may substantially reduce current captial investment and operating costs. But he emphasized that innovative technology alone may not encourage new investment, that oil prices need to show a meaningful and sustained recovery. Most of the expenses associated with heavy oils production is fixed operating costs as in an oil sands project, rather than in exploration, according to Robert Smith, Senior VP Operations <Syncrude Canada Ltd>. While exploration costs for conventional crude oil range from four to nine dlrs a barrel, discovery costs for synthetic crude from oil sands are nearly zero because the location and nature of the deposit are known, according to Smith. But the remote location of oil sands deposits mean that everything required to build and operate the plant must come from outside the area. Willmon also said, "Public policy could best help by providing financial support to offset the high cost of technology developmemt which would help generate projects that could survive even at low oil prices for extended periods of time." U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said, "The Reagan Administration is firmly committed, without equivocation, to continuing our efforts to improve conditions and incentives in the marketplace that will spur oil and gas exploration and development."

interest, money-fx	BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies. In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements. "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987. Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods, services and investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends. Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off. "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity," Koehler said. The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S. Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems. The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect. "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term," Koehler said. A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand. In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should rise faster than GNP. "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said. If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S.. But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the U.S. When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions. Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates. It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability, economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem, the debt problem and the current account problem. A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said. Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set, because they were only testing points for the market, he said. In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said. REUTER

He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied: "Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters." Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together. REUTER

He described the situation as "extremely tense," but said Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices because supply and demand were roughly equal. Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now pumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference. Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction continued.

crude	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said. The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector. Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982. But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long. Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price. Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987. King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy. Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985. Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981. "Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects," a diplomat said. In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs. But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term. It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy. Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to "tough it out" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves. The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out. Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year. "It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy," he said. Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary. The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom. Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply. The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit. Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment. Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit. As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the United States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags. The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War. "The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration," Oakley said. She emphasized, however, that "if some charter arrangement could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis." In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navy escort in the Gulf, she said. The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan, administrator of the Martime Administration, as saying Kuwait has approached an American shipping company about the possibility of a charter. Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives of the company, whose identify he did not know, that chartered vessels flying the U.S. flag "would be protected," the newspaper reported. Concerning Saudi Arabia, Oakley said "we are moving forward in our talks ... on how we can tailor our efforts and security cooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations." Reuter

He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has the capacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refining centers in Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the United States. The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in the Corpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, a subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp <UNP>. Earlier it bought a similar stake in the Lake Charles, La refinery owned by Citgo Petroleum Corp, a unit of Southland Corp <SLC>. According to the official, Venezuela is searching worldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did not mention where the company was looking. Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to refiners. He said Venezuela currently produces about 1.4 mln bpd of crude oil, which is in line with its 1.495 bpd OPEC ceiling. Reuter

crude	TURKEY CALLS FOR DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DISPUTE Turkey said today its disputes with Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea, should be solved through negotiations. A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute and an agreement on this issue would effect the security, economy and other rights of both countries. "As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be found by bilateral negotiations," the statement said. Greece has repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the International Court of Justice. The two countries approached armed confrontation last month after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil. A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to territorrial waters. "The latest crises created an historic opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries," the Foreign Ministry statement said. Turkey's ambassador in Athens, Nazmi Akiman, was due to meet Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today for the Greek reply to a message sent last week by Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal. The contents of the message were not disclosed. Reuter
dlr, money-fx	BUNDESBANK BUYS DOLLARS IN FRANKFURT - DEALERS The Bundesbank bought large amounts of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar above 149 yen, dealers said. The dollar intervention was in concert with some other central banks, they said. Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that these two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also active yesterday. The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks. Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges following last month's agreement in Paris by six leading countries to foster currency stability. One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the Bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy dollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves. He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with other central banks. Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had until yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above 150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test central banks' resolve to defend currency stability. But the test came this week with the dollar falling below 1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S. Trade deficit were behind the weakness. This week's intervention showed central banks were prepared to cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said. Dealers said it was significant the West German and British central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen. That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by central banks to foster currency stability, they said. But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged and how frequent consultations between central banks were. REUTER

crude	CONGRESSMAN SAYS U.S. UNPREPARED FOR OIL CUTOFF Rep. Mike Synar said today that while President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared at home to deal with a new energy crisis. Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S. participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing program of the International Energy Agency. The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal with any future oil cutoff. Synar said, "the president is prepared to take military action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our nation for the next energy crisis." Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil, increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar, who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in a previous IEA test, said the United States successfully advocated a test limited to training participants in oil sharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.

The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May, three months longer than planned. The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the time, as happens now, the paper said. The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of Hormuz. It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against Iraq. U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of those missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quoted officials as saying. From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launch aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships could fire long-range missiles, the paper said. REUTER

crude	AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia's petroleum taxation structure. The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government's position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference. As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum. APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said. It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation. Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure. "The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based," the APEA council said. The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's problems, the council said. The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices. REUTER
crude	PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE Crude oil prices could remain around 18 dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen. Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter. "Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago," he said. He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels. The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output. "I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions," Lajous said. A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is always there as a possibility, he said. "I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained," he said. Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control. He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output, were "very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer."

The report states that total net proved reserves at year's end stood at 2.5 billion barrels, an increase of 94 mln barrels or four pct above the previous year and detailed data show that the gains resulted from an increase in net proved reserves of natural gas liquids. Mobil said gains were in Indonesia where a sixth production facility began operation in October with a capacity to manufacture 1.7 mln tonnes of liquified natural gas. The company also said that new capacity brought onstream last year replaced 120 pct of Mobil's production, which declined by about four pct in 1986 from the previous year. Detailed data on reserves shows that U.S. net proved reserves of crude oil fell to 837 mln barrels from 853 mln barrels in 1985, natural gas liquid reserves were also lower in 1986 from the previous year. Net proved crude oil reserves also fell in Canada to 224 mln barrels and in Europe to 403 mln barrels from the previous year's level of 231 mln barrels and 439 mln barrels, respectively. Reuter
crude	ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said. Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said. "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects," said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity. "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state's drilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said. "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs," Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled. "I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year," Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission. In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation. "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels," Guerard said. Reuter

In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."

Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this fall.

Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by "a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world." U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf. The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf. U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship "Silkworm" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before. The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were "misleading propaganda." He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use "all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension." Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. "We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway." "We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area," he said. Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual. A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea.

money-fx	AFTER G-6, ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS Central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange market's first test of the industrialized nations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said. In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar, sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure. "So far G-6 has been a roaring success,"said James O'Neill, financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA. "The central banks are sending strong signals that they won't tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies," added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank. On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K. -- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels. The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two-year decline against major world currencies. And initially, traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower. But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87 marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G-6 accord. The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing. But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines. Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions. But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around 1.85 marks. "The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon," said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill. Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K. currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the G-6 pact. Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar/mark and dollar/yen. The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving U.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election. "There was a real run on sterling," said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870 dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday and from a peak of about 2.98 recently. "There's been some heavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday's U.K. budget," said James McGroarty of Discount Corp. As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and British central banks, they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were stymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise. The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar today, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday. And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent, sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said. The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents today from a high of 69.02 Thursday. Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle sudden upward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next step. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months. The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night. Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling/short mark positions established lately. "Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen," a dealer at one U.K. bank said. Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders, lower industrial output and slowing employment gains. Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas, for example in Australian financial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31. Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with Japan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency. In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28. On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen. "Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in January. But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the situation changes," said McGroarty of Discount. Reuter
grain, wheat	HOUSE 0/92 PLAN SEEN SCALED-BACK TO 1987 WHEAT Key members of the House Agriculture committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later, Congressional sources said. The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn English (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat. This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987 wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat. Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still collect 92 pct of deficiency payments. Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 0/92. The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92, and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill. Congressional sources said there has not been enough time to study the implications of a broad 0/92. "The timing (of the proposal) is off," said one aide to a House Agriculture committee member. However, several Congressional sources said they expect a broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part of an overall deficit reduction package. Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley (D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may exceed one billion dlrs. A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration estimate it would result in significant budget savings. A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all 1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5 billion dlrs over five years. Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the approach of planting season, Congressional sources said. Some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for wheat and feedgrains. If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either would have to be extended or reopened, sources said. Reuter

crude	TRITON ENERGY <OIL> AFFILIATE IN CANADIAN FIND Triton Energy Corp said its 70 pct owned <Canadian Worldwide Energy Ltd> affiliate's Lasmo et al Tableland 4-36-2-10W2 well in Saskatchewan flowed 567 barrels of 37 degree gravity oil through a 17/64 inch choke from depths of 8,531 to 8,548 feet and 636 barrels of oil per day through a 20/64 inch choke from depths of 8,500 to 8,507 feet. Triton said because of the well's status as a deep exploratory well, production qualifies for a five-year royalty holiday under the Saskatchewan drilling incentive products. It said the well's initial production is expected to be restricted to an allowable level of about 300 barrels a day, although it is capable of sustaining much higher rates. The company said London and Scottish Marine Oil PLC owns a 50 pct interest in the well and its spacing unit, Canadian Worldwide 25 pct, <Saskatchewan Oil and Gas Corp> 10 pct, <Interprovincial Pipeline Ltd's> Home Oil Co Ltd 7.5 pct and Scurry-Rainbow Oil Ltd <SRB> 7.5 pct.

crude, nat-gas	OIL EXECUTIVES SEE GRADUAL RISE IN PRICES Top executives with Tenneco Corp <TGT> and Sabine Corp <SAB> said they expected world oil prices to gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on imports of oil from the Middle East grows. "I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a trend of gradually increasing prices," C.W. Nance, president of Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association. Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the rate of 80 pct of capacity. The gain will come largely through increased imports to the United States, he said. "They will be able to raise the price again but I do not think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979," Nance said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected. Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20 dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in 1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between 1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988. "Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in increased demand," Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15 pct, he said. Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability. Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20 pct during 1986, he said. "This does not mean the gas bubble is gone," Nance said. "We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three years before we start to climb out?" J.C. Walter of <Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent producers to begin new onshore drilling projects. "If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal," Walter said. He suggested that some independents may instead turn to exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel, Walter said. Reuter
money-fx	U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING A steep drop in goods-producing jobs detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar, economists said. U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with February's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February. "The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter," said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. "This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters." "The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy," he said. "They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but clearly they can't tighten." David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected. While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct. Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986. "There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, but less than assumed," he said. "Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes." In March, the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February. The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs. Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead. Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts. Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial activity "is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP." Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March. They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income. Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January. The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February. "This just means that there were fewer people looking for work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much," he said. He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct, but "it does suggest they can't afford to tighten to quickly either." The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth. Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week. "At some point they will be more inclined to ease," he said. For the time being, however, the March employment report "increases the likelihood they won't tighten, regardless of the dollar." Reuter
money-fx	NIGERIAN CURRENCY FIRMS AT LATEST AUCTION The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct against the dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at today's weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said. The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 last week. Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold, with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency. The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last week. The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as punishment for inadequate documentation in previous transactions. Banks are required to submit proof that their bids are based on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has complained in the past that many are failing to produce the right paperwork within the specified time.

money-fx	GERMAN CALL MONEY EASES AFTER LIQUIDITY INJECTION Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from 3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week's securities repurchase agreement, dealers said. But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week. A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers, payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System (EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow. The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as an earlier securities repurchase pact matured. Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six billion marks. The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to redeem them meant a net infusion was needed. Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks, but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week. Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled 53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the first nine days of March. Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet the requirement toward the end of March. No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week, but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if conditions significantly tighten. "The Bundesbank wants to keep rates around 3.80 pct," one dealer said. REUTER
grain, wheat	AUSTRALIAN WHEAT AREA TO FALL, FORECASTER SAYS Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72 mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF) said in its first preliminary crop forecast. But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year, the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season. Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said. The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average, AWF said. Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops. "The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers' income," AWF said. AWF's state area forecasts in mln hectares, with 1986/87 production in mln tonnes, are as follows (crop forecasts were not given for the new wheat year) Area Crop 1987/88 1986/87 1986/87 Queensland 0.82 0.82 0.95 N.S.W. 3.07 3.17 4.40 Victoria 1.53 1.63 3.25 S.Australia 1.45 1.64 2.30 W.Australia 3.53 4.46 5.60 REUTER

The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years, started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not return to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners have offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected. "We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the workers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our protest until the end," a union leader said. He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines take over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and let the marines handle the situation by themselves. A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national security. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has cut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle. Petrol station owners in four states also continued their shutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage. REUTER

ship	NEITHER SIDE OPTIMISTIC ON ROTTERDAM PORT ISSUES Employers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told Reuters. Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions. "There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking," a union spokesman said. Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months. "The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all." "If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector, then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month," Schoufour said. The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with 350 this year. Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw the sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy. Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out their cases, but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from him before Wednesday at the earliest. Reuter
crude, nat-gas	U.S. ENERGY INDUSTRY SAID IN BETTER HEALTH The U.S. oil and gas industry is in better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of the industry hearing today. The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry downturn had bottomed out. "The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal more optimistic (than last year)," Commissioner James E. (Jim) Nugent told Reuters. "It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are seeing the bottom of the economic cycle," he added, "and with just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move again." The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to around 18 dlrs a barrel. At the same time, a number of company executives testified that the nation's domestic exploration and production segment was still hurting and in need of government help. Production costs are considerably higher in the United States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell many domestic producers were forced to shut down their operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs operating in the United States compared with an average of nearly 2,000 in 1985. Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing dependency on imports, particularly from the politically volatile Middle East. "In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day (bpd)," said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply Department at Exxon Corp <XON>, the nation's largest oil company. At the same time, Simon said "U.S. oil production declined by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years," and "net petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd." Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at 1986 levels, leading to "a significant amount of spare worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd." He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued volatility and called for "governmental and regulatory policies in support of the domestic petroleum industry." Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal government through the 1986 tax code changes and "Superfund" legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access to federal lands for oil and gas exploration. Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the industry have called for as a way of building up the nation's domestic operations before imports reach such a level that national security might be compromised. In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the free world's total oil consumption by that date. Arguing that "oil is a political tool in every nation on earth," Frank Pitts, chairman of <Pitts Oil Co>, today called for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, "before the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and our national security is compromised." Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co, agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a "shambles." Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future. "For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is over," he said. Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co, said he was "enthusiastic about the future," adding that he expected "an increase in profitability by midyear." Reuter

crude	ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000, probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars. "I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000). Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," Hodel told the Senate Energy Committee. Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration. Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay. "The area could contain potentially recoverable oil resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production," Hodel said. He said production from the new section could begin about the time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000 without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area. Reuter

In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack, Reagan said the American people were aware that "it is not our interests alone that are being protected." Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret, Reagan declared, "During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will be discussing the common security interests shared by the western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf. "The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand alone." Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which will take place in Venice June 8-10. The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf shipping and demands that the allies do more. These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen. "They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its vital interests," Reagan said. In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system. "While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world economy is the business of every member of the world trading community," he said. "It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading system on which they depend." Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with allied accords on exchange rate stability. "Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten," he said. "The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action." Reuter

He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen. Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the U.S. over semiconductors. The yen's tendency to rise will prevent Japan from expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic restructuring, he said. Reuter

In a speech to a women's group here, Johnson said, "There is room for stronger domestic growth in those countries ... strong enough to absorb growth in U.S. export markets." Johnson also said there was a better alignment of exchange rates now and the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies has brought western nations a long way towards establishing that goal. Johnson said, "The Fed supports this pattern of exchange rates ... and we'll see if it leads to a convergence in trade. Quite possibly it can be achieved." Johnson said the Paris agreement achieved a better alignment of exchange rates in exchange for stimulus by the major surplus countries. He said this was "a major improvement and a step in the right direction" and added U.S. allies look very strongly to a U.S. budget deficit cut. "There will always be a potential risk of breakdown in international cooperation" without a budget deficit cut. Reuter

In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submitted bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres. The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre. Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with permanent vegetative cover. Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn "bonus" rental payment that was offered by USDA. The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comodity certificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCS program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn based accepted into the reserve. The state showing the biggest enrollment in the conservation program during this signup was Texas with approximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mln acres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, and Kansas with 842,000 acres. Other states showing big enrollment were Missouri with 646,000 acres, North Dakota with 588,000 acres, and Nebraska with 554,000 acres. In the corn belt states of Illinois and Indiana, 217,000 acres and 116,000 acres respectively were enrolled. Farm land signed up to date in the conservation program totals 19,488,587 acres.

ship	TOWNSEND FERRY INQUIRY TOLD BOW DOORS TO BLAME The Zeebrugge ferry disaster, in which around 200 people drowned seven weeks ago, was almost certainly caused by the ship leaving port with its bow doors wide open, a British government inquiry was told. Lawyer David Steel, representing the government, told the opening session of a public inquiry into the March 6 tragedy that this was "the only tenable explanation." The ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, is owned by Townsend Thoresen, part of P and O's <PORL.L> subsidiary European Ferries Group. Steel, commissioner of wrecks for England and Wales, said the inquiry would probably conclude that the ferry capsized in calm seas and fair weather a mile outside the Belgian port when water poured into the car deck. "We think you will also conclude that the immediate cause of that was that the doors were open, he said. Steel told the tribunal it appeared no attempt was made to close either the inner or outer bow doors prior to what should have been a routine voyage to the English port of Dover, despite a provision in the ship's "Stability Booklet" that the doors were to be closed and kept closed.

The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the field's operator through the development phase, with Statoil taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s. Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision had been taken and several questions remained unresolved. It was unlikely the government would announce its decision on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies, the sources added. This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by Conoco. Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as the most likely candidate for the first field development project on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway. Reuter

crude	UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS The "cross field allowance" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co. The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval. A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field. "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced. The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said. On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said. In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct. The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost. Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time. Reuter

crude, nat-gas	AMOCO <AN> OIL RESERVES DOWN, GAS UP IN 1986 Amoco Corp's petroleum liquids reserves total 2.42 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.77 billion a year earlier, but its natural gas reserves increased to 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the company's annual report said. It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision of 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision occurring in the United States, the report said. Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last year, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased 298 billion cubic feet of reserves. Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these gains, the report said. All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14 mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United States, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years. Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions "will be an integral part of our strategy, should reserves become available at attractive prices." The company said it expects "the marketing climate for natural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide the opportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demand improve, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our inventory of attractive opportunities." Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget of 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrs last year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985. Reuter

dlr, money-fx	EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much. The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it. Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range. "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs. However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday. Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen. A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term. London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside. Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the near term, the traders said. Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend. Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting." Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said "They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said. However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen. Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year. One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar. The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range. A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement." But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability. "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months. A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and should not have produced disappointment. "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade policies to redress current imbalances are of a different timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told Reuters, "This is a political process which takes time." Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on currency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent remedy?" he asked. Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully in the next few weeks for any changes in positions. A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position. Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to support the Paris accord.

dlr, money-fx	DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates, senior foreign exchange dealers said. Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down. Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down, the dealers said. "The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement," said Koji Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury division. He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency. "This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention," Kidokoro said. Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency. They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers, and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York. Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen. "If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the Americans don't want," said Haruya Uehara, chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31. But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package. "The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in stimulating its economy," said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division. In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax. In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said. Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar. REUTER
crude, ship	IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS Iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said. The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran's oil export trade. A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war front. It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf. Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their occupants and the others fled, it said. Reuter
dlr, money-fx	CURRENCY INTERVENTION TIMING CRUCIAL - ANALYSTS The dollar's recent decline, despite massive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment, dealers and analysts said. Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, without accompanying policy changes, they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, the sources said. "Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention," said Jim O'Neill, a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention. After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to 7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50 yen, up two yen from Tuesday's New York low. By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low Monday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar. The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central bank foray, but is no longer mesmerized. "They've lost their credibility. The market feels it can take on the central banks and win," said Michael Snow, head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September 22, 1985, Plaza accord. Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it, because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances. Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries. For its part, the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say. Specifically, they said the Fed's dollar-buying intervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets. "It's been pro-forma intervention," said Francoise Soares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais. Because of this discord and the market's momentum for a lower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail. "It's going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar (at these levels)," said Snow, who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation. "There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars," added "Buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it." Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack, central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said. Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. "I don't think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw the futility of it in the seventies." Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then, intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market. Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a joint central bank study, about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group. There are signs that central banks, too, realize the futility of swimming against the tide. Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks, are being considered. "In this era of financial liberalization, it's almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan," one senior official in Tokyo said. Reuter

In Finland and Sweden up to 50 vessels were reported to be stuck in the ice, and even the largest of the assisting icebreakers were having difficulties in breaking through to the stranded ships, coastguard officials said. However, icy conditions in the southern Baltic at the Soviet oil ports of Ventspils and Klaipeda had eased, they said. Weather officials in neighbouring Sweden said the icy conditions in the Baltic were the worst for 30 years, with ships fighting a losing battle to keep moving. In the coastal stretches of the Gulf of Bothnia, which divides Finland and Sweden, the ice is up to one metre thick, with drifts and currents packing it into almost impenetrable walls three metres high, Swedish coastguard officials said. Weather forecasts say winds may ease during the weekend but a further drop in temperature could bring shipping to a standstill, the officials said. Reuter
grain, wheat	U.S. FEEDGRAIN 0/92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION Advocates of a 0/92 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional sources said. The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English (D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat. An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers. Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat, it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally, they said. If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week, sources said. English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear. Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an even greater cutback in the bill, they said. Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments. Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.) have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to include a 0/92 program for feedgrains. An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill, but to be fair to all crops. Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land, economists said. Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such a program.

DEALERS BELIEVE FED INTERVENED TO BUY DLRS The Federal Reserve appears to have intervened in the U.S. foreign exchange market to buy dollars against yen this morning, currency dealers said. They said the intervention occurred near the dollar's early low of 148.50 yen and the U.S. currency subsequently firmed to 149.05/15. It closed at 150.00/05 on Monday. Dealers were uncertain of the amount involved and whether the Fed's purchases were for its own account or for a customer. But there was speculation that it may have been done in conjunction with the Bank of Japan. Tokyo dealers said the Japanese central bank bought dollars in Tokyo earlier today. Reuter

Alan Powers, chief of the Minerals Maanagement Service for the department, said the delay is to have more time to study the effects of drilling noise on whale migrations. Powers said the state has asked for additional noise data for the sale area off Alaska's North Slope. A new date has not been set, but it will likely be no sooner than next March, Powers said. Some 3,930 blocks encompassing about 21 mln acres are involved in the proposed sale.

In response to hostile questioning from a member of the House Appropriations Committee, the officials said the plan was justified to help bring the fiscal 1988 budget deficit and to get the government out of the oil business. Miller acknowleged the estimated sale proceeds at 3.3 billion dlrs would actually bring down the deficit by about 2.2 billion dlrs because of the loss of revenues from the sale of oil from the reserves. Miller said the sale price may end up higher. "We'd sell it to the highest bidder," Miller said. "If we can get more we'll take it." Reuter

money-fx	JAPAN CAREFULLY CONSIDERING MONEY POLICY -- SUMITA Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar. Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year. Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said. Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices, exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan. Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said. The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said. REUTER

Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier A/S <KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said. Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S <AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig. Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several months earlier than previously planned. Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km west of Bergen. Statoil estimates the field's total development cost, including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas. Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields. Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55 pct share, <Unocal Norge A/S> (18 pct), <Deminex (Norge) A/S> (13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S <NHY.OL> (nine pct) and <Svenska Petroleum AB> (4.5 pct).

money-fx	FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY Finance ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth. In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a "good meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome. Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly. The communique said, "The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances." It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" including an "unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures." The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels. In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows. Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports. The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate. It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."

In a wide ranging address sponsored by the Export-Import Bank, Ortner, the bank's senior economist also said he believed that the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct. "I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen," he said. On the other hand, Ortner said that he thought that "the yen is still a little bit undervalued," and "could go up another 10 or 15 pct." In addition, Ortner, who said he was speaking personally, said he thought that the dollar against most European currencies was "fairly priced." Ortner said his analysis of the various exchange rate values was based on such economic particulars as wage rate differentiations. Ortner said there had been little impact on U.S. trade deficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of the Plaza Accord, the dollar was extremely overvalued and that the first 15 pct decline had little impact. He said there were indications now that the trade deficit was beginning to level off. Turning to Brazil and Mexico, Ortner made it clear that it would be almost impossible for those countries to earn enough foreign exchange to pay the service on their debts. He said the best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlined in Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt initiative. Reuter
grain, wheat	HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS The 1988 agriculture budget will have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said. Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending, said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved. Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988 budget, Glickman added. Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year. "The administration's target price proposals are dead in the water," he said. To cut the budget, Glickman said, "everthing is on the table," except those moves that would reduce farmers' income. Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee will study in order to cut farm spending. Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and 1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year. Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or "pik') certificates will also be another option his committee will study, Glickman said. While not committing himself for or against such action, he said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which indicate certificates cost more than cash payments. Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and tightening up of the person definition for annual payment limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs. He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would not be in favor of such a change. Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's, EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand this program while making cuts in other areas. Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said. "I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping block," Glickman said. Reuter

"Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what they want to do," the official said. If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union, he said, "Shultz will not wage a vigorous campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but he won't go to the President and voice his objections." In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers, the State Department said, "Secretary Shultz expressed his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union. The Agriculture Department is in the best position to determine whether consideration should be given at this time to extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement Program." Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to Moscow, the State Department official said. "Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy." USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said. The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring U.S. prices down to competitive levels. The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the State Department source said. "What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the lowest price being paid by anyone in the world," he said. The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said. Government and commodity sources also said there are elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets. "Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a foregone conclusion," the State Department official said. Reuter

"No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting all shipping in those waters," Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the protective U.S. military presence in the gulf. Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq. "As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are under our protection with the exception, on a limited case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the region," Sims said. U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and Kuwait.

He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.

"The nation would be lucky to produce over seven mln bags (630,000 tonnes) of maize this year," he stated. Chinkuli added that Zambia was setting up an irrigation fund with Canadian aid to lessen the effects of poor rainfall. REUTER
money-fx	GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS German banking authorities are weighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments, banking sources said. Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To Japan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division of banking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate. But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals. "There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter stages," one representative of the German Banking Association in Cologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year. All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West Germany's four major banking associations and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office. Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of Germany's credit law, which has been in effect since 1934. Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said. Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves, on a consolidated basis. But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts, currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs, currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges. The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor, and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk. U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous. This is the so-called market-to-market value. But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved, the sources said. The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers. A further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said. Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S. And British authorities, the sources said. One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different. How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead-manage mark eurobonds. But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement, particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet, the sources added.

President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying. "We have to study this more," Reagan said. "This is why we increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do more," he said. Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production. However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures. The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It suggested options for the administration to consider, but made no specific recommendations. Reuter

crude	SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's oil-dependent economy. The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices. The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea, has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day. Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance. Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy. The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans. Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel. With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves. The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community. Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans. But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said: "Banks are still reluctant to lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am not sure if it is firmly based." Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting. Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said: "While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government's highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry." It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here. Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986, compared with the same period in 1985. Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983. Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit. Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments. The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt. Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom. A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg.

However, the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified, would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord, which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February, to be strengthened. Currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow, the Japanese officials said. The meeting, which is being held in conjunction with this week's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions, will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord, the officials said. Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates, officials said, but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion. The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention. The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan, which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency, but also for the benefit of the United States as well. As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus, Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7, the officials said. However, Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the Diet, or parliament, despite the new fiscal year which started April one, the officials said. Japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5,000 billion yen in additional spending. Reuter

grain, wheat	AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS Australia could lose valuable wheat markets through lack of availability if plantings for the coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said. "If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its valuable markets," he said in a statement. Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May. However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were facing enormous financial pressures. He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about 16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available. If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said. "Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat understand a decrease in production due to drought but they will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to decrease production," Condon said. "If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export income earner, governments and government authorities will need to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing viability of the wheat industry," he added. Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan. REUTER

dlr, money-fx	DOLLAR VALUE APPROPRIATE, BUNDESBANK OFFICIAL SAYS The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen, and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth, a top Bundesbank official said. Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies "can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective." He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald "an era of greater exchange rate stability." The Paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates, Gleske stressed, adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level. "At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen," Gleske said. He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary. But "a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by its weighted external value," he said. In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers, Gleske said. First, in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses. Second, in the United States, it could damage investors' confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, Gleske said. Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating in narrow bands against each other, can be established. Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts, "both within countries and between them." For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels, but domestic considerations call for low ones. If target zones were established, this would put "pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more, even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities," he said. Gleske added, "targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities." Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained. These chances "seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates, and the monetary policies behind them, will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead." Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned "that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot." He said this "would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible." Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments, he said. REUTER

The report also favoured retention of the lira's six pct oscillation band with the European Monetary System (EMS) during the liberalization process in order to lessen short-term domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from portfolio adjustments. The lira's fluctuation margin is currently significantly higher than that allowed for other EMS currencies.

crude, ship	LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US Military experts say the United States faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a U.S.-flagged tanker. The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes. But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war. "Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues," said Fred Axelgard, a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). "It's like a Greek tragedy," said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank. Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq. They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which President Reagan could never accept. U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday. Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday. Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape. "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said. "We consider this matter closed," he said. Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken this view after earlier clashes. Reuter

"He (Lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talk about an EEP (export enhancement program) initiative to the Soviet Union," said Glen Hofer, vice president of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives. Another participant in the meeting, who asked not to be identified, said Lyng was "unresponsive" to the group's request.

Hofer described Lyng as "sympathetic but noncommittal," and said he thought he detected "a sense of frustration" on Lyng's part at not being able to respond more positively to the group's urging. A grain industry representative said some participants were "puzzled" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before the cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets. "There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to the idea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been," this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referring to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets. This official said there was not a significant amount of pressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEP offer to Moscow. Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such an offer, this official said Lyng had received virtually no phone calls from lawmakers on the subject. But Hofer said other important matters at the White House, rather than an absence of political pressure, might have restrained Lyng. Reuter

A Foreign Ministry statement last night hinted Turkey was claiming victory. A Greek-based international consortium, North Aegean Petroleum Co., Had given up plans to start searching for oil in international waters east of Thasos island, it said. "In the same way it has been understood that Greece will also not undertake oil activities outside its territorial waters," the statement added. An Ankara Radio report monitored in London said Foreign Minister Vahit Halefolu had called on Greece to engage in dialogue over the dispute. It was impossible to resolve the dispute by crises, he was quoted as saying. "We call on Greece to come and engage in a dialogue with us - let us find a solution as two neighbours and allies should," he said. The radio said Halefoglu had briefed the leaders of a number of the country"s political parties on the latest developments. Turkey sent the survey ship Sismik 1 into the Aegean yesterday, flanked by warships, to press its case but having earlier said it would go into disputed waters, declared the vessel would stay in Turkish areas. Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, in London on his way home after heart surgery in the United States, is expected to receive an ecstatic welcome from thousands of Turks when he returns today. He was in defiant mood last night, telling Turkish radio: "We can never accept that Greece should confine us to the Anatolian continent. If there are riches under the sea, they are for mankind." Despite the end of the crisis, Turkish officials acknowledged that the underlying dispute over delimiting the continental shelf in the Aegean remained unsolved. Turkey alleged that the consortium"s plans would have infringed the 1976 Berne agreement between the two countries, which called for a moratorium on any activities until the delimitation was agreed.

dlr, money-fx	YEN MAY RISE TO 140 TO THE DLR, NIKKEIREN SAYS The yen could rise to 140 yen to the dollar, a leading Japanese businessman said. Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told reporters: "The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar). The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)." "The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S. Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise," he said. To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen, Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means, including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said. He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand. "We have to keep wages as low as possible," he said. He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports. Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki said. Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries, he said. It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he said. Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible recession in the Japanese economy, he said. Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986. The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil price crisis. In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

interest, money-fx	KAUFMAN SAYS GREENSPAN NOMINATION BAD FOR BONDS Henry Kaufman, managing director of Salomon Brothers Inc, said the nomination of economist Alan Greenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and currency markets. "The basic direction of interest rates is not changed. The fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward, interrupted by intermittent rallies," Kaufman said in a statement. He said the implication for equity markets in neutral to bullish. Kaufman said, "Unlike Paul Volcker, who entered the office of the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility both domestically and internationally, Mr Greenspan will have to demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before he can gain full confidence of the financial markets." Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S. economy, while his professional skills in the international area are much more limited, Kaufman noted. "Consequently, although he is well known abroad, his views on issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially carry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker." Reuter
crude	LUKMAN SEES STABLE OIL PRICE FOR NEXT COUPLE YEARS The current crude oil price of between 18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said. Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government officials said. They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third World debt and industrialised nations. Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said. Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he said. This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high prices, he added. Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled. REUTER

dlr, money-fx	DOLLAR DROP SEEN AS TEST OF PARIS AGREEMENT The sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month's Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies, dealers and bank economists said. "The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention," one dealer for a German bank said, echoing widepread sentiment in the market. But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists. Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further. Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention, the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today. It was quoted as low as 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the U.S. Currency to decline further. "The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range," Chase Bank AG's senior dealer Eckhart Hager said. Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop. "Window-dressing" operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the U.S. Currency. Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollar down. "Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared," one dealer said. The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5 billion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said. Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France, the U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact. But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning. Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act. While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marks or if the decline accelerated. The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when the dollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks. "The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment," one dealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done. Some said Baker's remarks and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter's warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift. "It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands," a dealer said. Another added, "If the Americans do not get what they want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6." Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter. "It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary U.S. Fiscal contraction," Citibank said. It added, "Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marks or even less is expected this year." And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report, "We are looking for a further, more gradual, fall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year." But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal. Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker's and Yeutter's comments. "There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down," a senior dealer said. REUTER

crude, nat-gas	U.S ENERGY SECRETARY PROPOSES OIL TAX INCENTIVES Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. "These options boost production, while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee," Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. "It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review." He said proposals, including an increase in the oil depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax, should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers. "The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a year." The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday warning the United States was threatened by a growing dependence on oil imports. "We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65 pct by 1995," Herrington said. He said it was too soon to say what the Administration policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would be opposition to tax changes. "Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been favored by the administration. I think what we need is to debate this within the Administration," he said. He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices. Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today's Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging an increase in the oil depletion allowance. Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington said various proposals were under consideration and would be debated within the Administration to determine which would have the most benefits at the least cost.

In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said that he had no knowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within the cabinet. Asked if the administration had ruled out offering to subsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under the department's export enhancement program, Lyng said, "No. We haven't made a decision on it, haven't even talked about it, haven't even looked at it." Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buy U.S. wheat if competitively priced, Lyng responded, "If they (the Soviets) would offer to buy some wheat, would we accept it? It would depend on what price they offered." Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheat was far off the world price. Asked about persistent speculation that the administration would offer Moscow a wheat subsidy, Lyng said, "Some people think they're doing it to see if they can get a little spurt in the market." Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz last week asked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate reports that wheat prices were being manipulated by reports that a U.S. wheat subsidy offer was imminent.

"The exchange rate policy of the dirham has realised its goals in the past and changes in this policy depend on coordination and cooperation with other GCC countries," he said. The GCC states -- the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait -- have agreed in principle to link their currencies to a common grid. Their currencies are now linked either to the dollar, IMF special drawing right (SDR) or, in the case of Kuwait, a trade-weighted basket of international currencies.

dlr, money-fx	DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates, senior foreign exchange dealers said. Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down. Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down, the dealers said. "The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement," said Koji Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury division. He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency. "This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention," Kidokoro said. Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency. They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers, and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York. Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen. "If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the Americans don't want," said Haruya Uehara, chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31. But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package. "The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in stimulating its economy," said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division. In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax. In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said. Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar. REUTER

The officials told Reuters yesterday the offer was made last week by Navy Admiral William Crowe, chairman of the Pentagon Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a Middle East visit. Reagan administration officials said later that Washington did not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would not let Iran use Chinese-made "Silkworm" anti-ship missiles, capable of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oil shipments to the West. Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for up to a dozen vessels, most of them tankers, could be provided by three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships, including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month. White House and defence officials said that massing the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran's stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf. The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been told about U.S. Concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communication was sent through Switzerland, which represents U.S. Interests in Iran. Iran denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf and said any U.S. Interference in the region would meet a strong response, Tehran Radio said on Sunday. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984 in the so-called tanker war, an offshoot of their 6-1/2-year-old ground conflict. REUTER

The company said profits in the lastest quarter included a 26 mln drl restructuring gain from divestment of certain gold operations overseas, while last year's first quarter profit of 1.71 billion dlrs included the initial charge of 235 mln dlrs for its 1986 corporate reorganization. First quarter revenues were down 13 pct to 19.44 billion dlrs. One time items aside, Exxon said, its first quarter results were stronger than 1986's final quarter which included several large asset sales and positive inventory adjustments. It said earnings per share declined 36 pct reflecting the company's continued purchases of its own common for the treasury. During the first quarter, 5,085,000 shares were acquired at a cost of 416 mln dlrs compared with 3,132,000 in 1986's fourth quarter. Commenting on the first quarter, Exxon said crude oil prices strengthened moderately within the quarter and were higher than a year ago at the end of the quarter. However, average crude prices for the quarter were below the year ago period, leading to lower earnings for exploration and production operations, Exxon said. Also contributing to reduced earnings were lower natural gas prices, primarily overseas, representing contract adjustments representing contract adjustments tied to falling product prices in 1986, the company said. During the first quarter, the company said, intense competition in both domestic and international markets served to depress margins for refined products. Exxon said the lower product margins resulted in significantly reduced earnings for refining and marketing operations, contrasting sharply with the unusually strong margins prevailing in the first qtr of 1986. It said savings from efforts to control costs and improve efficiency helped soften the negative impact of lower oil and natural gas prices. Exxon said earnings from chemicals and power generation activities showed consideratble improvement, remaining strong throughout the period. Reuter

In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been delaying deliveries. As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat. The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.

The variable import fee would be dropped if oil prices rise above 25 dlrs a barrel, sponsors of the bill said. Revenues from the fee would be used to buy domestic oil from stripper wells - those that produce 10 barrels a day or less - at a fixed price of 25 dlrs a barrel. Purchases would stop when prices rose above that level. "Time is running out on the domestic oil and gas industry," Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said in a statement.

The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi air strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack. Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway. U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a U.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iran attack but would not say what the decision was. REUTER

ship	STRIKING BRAZIL SEAMEN THREATEN MASS RESIGNATION Striking seamen said they would offer their collective resignation rather than end their 13-day-old national strike on management's terms. The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work under duress. President Jose Sarney's government despatched troops to Brazil's ports and oil installations on Tuesday. Seamen in Santos, Brazil's main port, are in defiant mood. One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the country's main ports. The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get, and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports. An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read, "The seamen's strike is illegal, irrational and unpatriotic." The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the union's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month. At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with allowances. "Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world, after Ghana's," dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct but have been offered less than half that. REUTER
crude	STUDY PREDICTS U.S. DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL A government study has concluded the U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability, the New York Times said. The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling domestic production and rising demand for imported oil. The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from 27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said. It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the current 8.4 mln barrels. The newspaper said the administration has placed increased emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day, rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget. The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the depletion allowance to major producers. "The administration also plans to renew its efforts to ...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers," it added. The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma as saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S. Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated the amount of domestic oil which would be produced.

dlr, money-fx	JAPAN MINISTRY ASKS TRUST BANKS TO CUT DLR SALES The Finance Ministry has asked trust banks to moderate their dollar selling, trust banking sources said. A Ministry official told Reuters earlier this week the Ministry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions by institutional investors, but he declined to say whether this was aimed at moderating the dollar sales. Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to sell dollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministry monitoring. One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizing with the Ministry position, the trust banks had to conduct their foreign exchange operations according to the dictates of the market. A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved of the survey as long it was not used too forcefully. But another official denied local press reports that the central bank itself had asked investors to moderate their dollar sales. "We are not legally authorized to do that," he said. A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank will renew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessive loans for the purpose of land and securities investment as such investments threaten to cause inflation. Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previously expressed concern about excessive investment in land and securities resulting partly from eased credit conditions. REUTER

money-fx	MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY The monetary authorities of the major industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention, dealers said. The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month's Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal of the success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza meeting to weaken the dollar, they said. The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides, dealers said. Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the United States, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said. Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was no target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway. Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said. The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita, which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they noted. The situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge currency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars. "This means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand," said Koichi Miyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank. Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its record low was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday. Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again. The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus Italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said. Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris accord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S. Trade deficit, especially with Japan. Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a lower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said. The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said Tadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September. The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation, dealers said. Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand, they said. The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting April 1, dealers said. "The market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between 147 and 149 yen," one dealer said. The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen, he said. Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148 yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to 145. REUTER

Exxon's new president Lee R. Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French refinery. An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that depended on the evolution of the market and refineries' ability to make money.

The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the spokesman added. Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.

grain, wheat	U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM The House of Representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant. The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate. Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S. Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure. USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed broad-scale revision of farm programs. The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received. To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring, although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay. USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs, largely because of reduced crop forfeitures. The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall's flooding. In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall. Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses. The administration said it opposed the bill because, by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance. USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings. USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs. USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs. In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments. But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program. Reuter

The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains. EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said. The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year. The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said. It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

He said it had also expanded operations to cover the whole region "from the most northerly point in the Persian Gulf to the most southerly part of the Sea of Oman." Referring to U.S. fleet movements in and near the Gulf, Malekzadegan said they had so far not been directed against Iran's interests.

"However, if any movement or action is carried out against the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran in whatever context, we shall decisively confront that move." Reuter

crude	OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said. He told a news conference here "After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices." Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned. "We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February," Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level. "The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs," Lukman said. He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said. "If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs," the group's president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely. "Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to," he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied "We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials." Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude. "We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year," Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market. "We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly," he said. Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster.

Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag. The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S. resolve that Iran "cannot take military action against the United States with impunity." Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf. While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S. retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan comply with the War Powers Act.

crude, nat-gas	PENNZOIL (PZL) WILLING TO SETTLE TEXACO (TX) LAWSUIT Pennzoil Co said it had not yet received any "meaningful settlement offer" from Texaco Inc but added that the company remained willing to consider proposals to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against Texaco. In its newly-released annual report to shareholders, Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be upheld if appealed again. "To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any realistic effort to settle the matter," Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke said in the annual report. Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year. Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to 964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program, Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985. The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339 mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17 pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by 60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said. U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per day in 1985. The company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs. Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of Mexico's Mobile Bay area. "Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California," the company said. "Pennzoil's share of this production initially should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of 15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989." In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled 2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton from 141.05 dlrs in 1985. "The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains bright," the company said. "We expect sulphur's pricing structure to strengthen during the current year, probably in the third and fourth quarters." Reuter
money-fx	CURRENCY FUTURES CLIMB LIKELY TO BE CHECKED The surge in currency futures since Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposed tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the coming week, financial analysts said. "The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it to last a little longer," said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co. Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some momentum today, is likely to continue, he said. Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said, even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6 nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said. Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner said G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of their commitment to the Paris accord. "I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the scenes," Horner said. Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures. "Coordinated, punishing intervention" by the central banks -- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to Horner. "I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans (currencies)," he said. On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract, is at 0.007050, Horner said. Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to peak. "The basic trend in the currencies is higher," said Anne Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "The market wants to take the dollar lower." Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price activity the remainder of the week, Mills said. In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role in coming sessions, the analysts said. Friday's employment statistics in particular will be closely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of 250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar. Reuter

But he added that arguments against joining had weakened. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest. But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers' meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership. In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism, there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered, he said. British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system, he noted. "We have to make sure it would work." But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem. As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency, which he said was diminishing. "That argument has clearly weakened," he said. Lawson restated that the government was keeping the question of membership under review. REUTER

dlr, money-fx	U.S. INTERVENED TO AID DLR IN JANUARY, FED SAYS U.S. authorities intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion during the period between the start of November 1986 and the end of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report. The Fed's quarterly review of foreign exchange operations said that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen on January 28. This operation was coordinated with the Japanese monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the U.S. Treasury. The Fed's intervention was on the morning after president Reagan's State of the Union message and was "in a manner consistent with the joint statement" made by U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations. At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange rate issues. The Fed's report did not say at what level the intervention occurred. But on January 28, the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yen after dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session. It had closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day. The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 149.98 yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 1.7675 marks on January 28. It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks. The Fed noted that, after trading steadily throughout November and the first half of December, the dollar moved sharply lower until the end of January. It closed the three-month review period down more than 11 pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and seven pct lower against the yen and sterling. It had fallen four pct against the Canadian dollar. During the final days of January, pressure on the dollar subsided. Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operation and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on exchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said. Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S. interest rates. The dollar's swift fall had raised questions about whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease. Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marks and 153.70 yen. According to the Fed's trade-weighted index, it had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period. The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen in early November. The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 7, 1985 when it bought a total of 102.2 mln dlrs worth of marks and yen. The Fed's action followed the September 1985 Plaza agreement between the five major industrial nations under which they agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar. Reuter

In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8 icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and engineering conditions before the contract is awarded. The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the construction of the vessel. said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will be required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically and financially capable of performing the work." Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of direct employment. Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and completed in 1992. The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast Guard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the journey, claiming the area was an international water way. The government said the icebreaker was needed to back up the country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic. Reuter

The measure was adopted as part of a wide-ranging trade bill that will be considered by the full House in April before it moves on to the Senate. The bill's many provisions also set as a priority for the U.S. the negotiation of stable exchange rates and urge government intervention as necessary to offset fluctuations. In addition, the Banking Committee bill would authorize U.S. banks to use a variety of means to deal with the debt problems of developing countries, such as lowering interest rates on existing debt, renegotiating loans or debt forgiveness. The bill would give a blanket waiver of any federal banking regulations that bar such actions. The bill would direct Treasury Secretary James Baker to discuss with debt-ridden developing countries the possibility of the U.S. setting up a public debt management agency that would purchase their debt at a discount and negotiate the restructuring of the debt. The Banking bill authorizes U.S. participation in a multilateral investment guarantee agency (MIGA) as requested by the administration.

grain, wheat	AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA The Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne. For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price, it said. Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said. In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives. But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90. The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports, the department said. Reuter

No further details on the loan were immediately available. Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast. The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery. The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said. Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project, he said.

crude	EXXON <XON> SEES DROP IN NEW OIL DISCOVERIES Exxon Corp chairman Lawrence Rawl said total world energy consumption will continue to grow, but added new oil discoveries worldwide are slowing down and can not offset annual production. In a speech at the World Petroleum Congress here, Rawl said oil companies would increasingly be forced to turn to enhanced recovery techniques, very heavy oil and synthetics to compensate for substantial declines in conventional oil production. "What our current outlook suggests is that total world energy consumption will continue to grow steadily in an ever more energy efficient world," Rawl said. But, he added, Exxon projects that "despite today's ample supplies, the world will also be facing up to inherent limitations on the availability of oil and gas, which currently supplies more than half of the world's energy needs." The Exxon chairman told some 1,500 oil executives from around the world that some synthetics projects could become practical when oil reaches 30 dlrs to 40 dlrs a barrel range in real terms. "The question is when and how this will happen," he said. "I believe that synthetic projects will not only re-emerge but will become commercial well below those we were thinking about the last time oil prices moved substantially higher." Rawl said synthetic fuel would become economic at lower prices because companies are investigating "a new generation of ideas that promise substantially lower costs" and projects begun in the late 1970s, which have since been suspended. Rawl also said companies must find new and more effective ways of enhanced recovery from existing oil fields. "It would be my view that new oil discoveries, even with advanced technology, are likely to slow down - not reverse - the decline in worldwide oil discoveries," he said. "So it is essential to find a better way to recover more of the discovered oil from producing fields using chemicals, solvents, heat, and other techniques." Rawl emphasized that private oil companies need some assistance from government in developing synfuels technology. "More importantly, they need to provide a political and economic environment that is stable enough to allow the developmental process to function effectively, he said. Rawl also said stable energy markets serve the best interest of producing and consuming nations by allowing both groups to plan for steady economic growth. He did not make any oil price prediction, saying only that the economic goals of the U.S. and other nations can only be achieved if world oil prices "stabilize within a reasonable range." "Prices must be high enough to meet realistic aspirations for income and encourage resource development in the producing countries, but not so high as to inhibit economic growth in consuming nations," he said. The Exxon chairman also criticized "the occasional attempt of consuming nations to try to control domestic oil prices, calling such protectionist measures disruptive to the world oil market. Reuter

grain, wheat	EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND The European Commission's decision to release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said. Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage, pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes were granted. The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm. The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission. There has been growing concern that rising internal prices, triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in interior markets. The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month. The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and June. News of the release produced an early downward reaction in local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved early two stg losses while others were unchanged. Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the free market. However, some traders believe these figures are overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off the market in futures stores. A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been sold for export or to the home market since the season started July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59 mln tonnes. Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said. This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all early expectations and has created the present nervous situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in August. The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes achieved in the 1984/85 season. Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and barley around 4.50 mln tonnes. The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28 mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders said. Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season. The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said. Reuter

grain, wheat	HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE A House Agriculture Committee meeting later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or "de-coupling," provision to cover feedgrains, and those who oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources said. The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year 0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments. The administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year. It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision will emerge from the committee, the sources said. Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs. Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill, committee staffers said. The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week. Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30. Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be implemented, an Agriculture Department source said. An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary. Major commodity groups, including the National Corn Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92. But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it should be extended to other crops. There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash. Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said. Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill. "Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the timing," a congressional staff member said. Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains. Reuter
money-fx	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. "The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common," said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. "Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict. REUTER
crude	IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct, it said. The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels. IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same level as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March. It is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, the IEA noted. Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Saudi Arabia"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd. REUTER
dlr, money-fx	JAPAN HAS NO PLANS FOR NEW MEASURES TO AID DLR Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support the dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention. He also told reporters that many major nations yesterday intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen. Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the countries involved and the amounts expended, he said. With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen, speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan might take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such as curbing capital outflows. Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in U.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although the growth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality are not that good, he said. He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways to stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week. Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring by a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone, Miyazawa said it was important to put the panel's recommendations into effect. REUTER
crude	TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN The oil services industry is on the verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil industry analysts said. The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half, and continue into the next decade. "People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying," said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>, Halliburton Co <HAL>, Dresser Industries <DI>, Baker International <BKO>, and McDermott International Inc <MDR>, which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor. Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S. "Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster," said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs. The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co <HT> figures show. The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. "The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988," Kerridge said. Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern, Kerridge said. "Halliburton is the best value," said Jeffrey Freedman, vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess, and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt. Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service stock. "Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry," Freedman said. "Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring, including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity," according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at Robert W. Baird and Co Inc. Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs. Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult. Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co. Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a pure service company, Sweeney said. Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup. Reuter
ship	CHINESE PORT UNDERUSED DESPITE CONGESTION NEARBY The Chinese port of Ningbo is working well below capacity despite being only 130 miles from Shanghai, which is seriously congested, a port official said. Jiang Feng Xiang said the port -- the deepest in China -- handled 17.95 mln tonnes of cargo last year, up from 10.44 mln in 1985, but well below its potential capacity of 32 mln tonnes. Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986. Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of its inadequate facilities, including a single track rail line linking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network. Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal from north to south China and imports include fertiliser and soda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks can handle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to 200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour. Most of Ningbo's port infrastructure has been built since 1979, official publications show. A container berth and two timber and three general cargo berths will be added during the current 1986-90 five-year plan, Jiang said. "The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995. By 2000, maybe, we will overtake Shanghai," he added. REUTER

He told al-Riyadh newspaper, "Saudi Arabia follows a balanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease in prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and find alternative sources (for energy)." OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system aimed to stabilise the market around 18 dlrs a barrel. OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it will review its current oil price and production policy. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil prices to remain stable for the next two years. Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and production pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of 15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs a barrel average. REUTER

dlr, money-fx	EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much. The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it. Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range. "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs. However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday. Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen. A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term. London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside. Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the long term, the traders said. Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend. Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting." Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said "They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said. However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen. Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year. One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar. The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range. A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement." But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability. "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months.

MORE As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community. Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system -- the French franc, Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.

crude, ship	BRAZILIAN BANK WORKERS DECIDE ON NATIONAL STRIKE Brazilian bank workers voted to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour unrest arising from the failure of the government's anti-inflation plan. At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24 unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met. Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks. The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company Petrobras. The government ordered thousands of troops into the refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the troops were removed yesterday. Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their willingess to negotiate next Wednesday. The government has also sent marines into the main ports. A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de Janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise. Seamen employed by two small companies have already accepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about 5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras. Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high interest rates charged by banks.

Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman and financier, said he believes the heady days the oil service industry had in the early 1980s, when over 4,500 oil rigs were once reported operating, will not return in his lifetime. Pickens told Reuters he expects the rig count to drop to below 600 before recovering. He added that oil prices will eventually rise to 35 dlrs, then to 50 dlrs after 1990. Currently, some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S., down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985 to around 10 dlrs in 1986. Prices are now around 18 dlrs. The highest number of working rigs was 4,500 in December 1981. "The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs," he said, adding that while he expects to see 50 dlr a barrel oil, he does not expect to see 2,000 rigs operating in his lifetime. Pickens is 58. Pickens, who is currently touring the country promoting his autobiography "Boone," said he does not believe the U.S. should impose an oil import fee in order to stimulate the domestic oil industry.

grain, wheat	IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD The International Wheat Council (IWC) lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season. In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in 1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments. The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln. The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere. The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect. At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off. Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise. After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987, the IWC said. Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC said. It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier. After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln tonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

money-fx	LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS U.S. And West German reaffirmation of support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets, London economists said. "There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip," said Richard Jeffrey of Hoare Govett. "If not, there is going to be continued fear that when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world." But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits. "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts. Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say. Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson. "It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates," he added. Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system. The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking crisis for example, thus precipitating recession. It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of 1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind. "The United States has been able to live on borrowed time. If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy," said Capel's Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in danger. "The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is disappearing from the equity markets," Dennis noted. David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar, as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on. Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability. But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said Morrison. "The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong," he said. Reuter
crude, ship	IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS Iraq said its warplanes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said. Reuter
crude, nat-gas	U.S. INTERIOR SECRETARY OPPOSES OIL IMPORT FEE U.S. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel said he does not support an oil import fee as a means to stimulate domestic oil and gas production. "I am an advocate for incentives for exploration," Hodel said, but added, "I do not favor an oil import fee." "It would inject the federal government so deeply back in to the process, we would never get the government out again, and I think that would be in the long term disinterest of the nation," Hodel said in an address to a group of local business executives. Earlier today, Congressmen from oil producing states introduced a bill that would impose a fee on oil imports. Hodel said he supports drilling incentives, such as repeal of the Windfall Profits Tax and Fuel Use Act and deregulation of natural gas. The secretary also said oil and gas exploration offshore California and in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge is necessary to prevent the U.S. from becoming too dependent on foreign supplies of oil for its energy needs. Failure to approve such exploration, Hodel said, would lead to greater U.S. dependence on foreign sources of oil. "In the next two to five years, no matter what we do today, we are very likely to find the U.S becoming 50 pct or more dependent on imports for its oil requirements," Hodel said. If OPEC were to raise oil prices sharply, Congress would likely act to have the federal government fix gasoline prices and allocate supplies, Hodel said. "If they allocate supplies you and I, in the same two-to-five year time frame, could well find ourselves sitting back in gas lines," Hodel said. Exploration for oil and gas in offshore areas and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would not jeopardize environmentally sensitive areas, Hodel said. "We are convinced we can meet and resolve every environmental concern that is raised," Hodel said. Reuter

crude	HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY CALL FOR OIL TAX BENEFITS Energy Secretary John Herrington said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels per day. The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day. Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints. Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce. He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security. Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy. He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one mln barrels a day. The report said that by the end of the century the United States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil consumption, posing a serious economic and national security threat. Reuter
interest, money-fx	LAWSON HAPPY WITH STERLING, BACKS LATEST RATE CUT Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut in British bank base lending rates to 10 pct. However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly. He told a briefing of economic journalists that "I don't think we should rush anything." Lawson stressed the themes of "gradualism and steadiness" as economic policy. Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of GDP. Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines, were "perfectly consistent" with monetary conditions now in Britain. He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply aggregate was "safely inside" its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3. Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS), Lawson repeated that "it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election." He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS membership under constant review. But he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls. Although Lawson denounced what he said was "the current wave of election fever" in Britain, he added: "It is more likely that there will be an election this year" than not. He said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air. "Ideally, we (the government) should have a full term," but events could force a premature poll, Lawson said. The government, which has been in power since 1979, must call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either a June or an early autumn election, political sources said. The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88 "was the right balance, economically and politically," he said. Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move. But it was being praised today by political analysts as a shrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate. Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg. Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson stressed that "they are not an objective (for the government) - they are an instrument of policy." Consequently the Treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said. But "there may be interest rate consequences" from changes in the level of government borrowing, he added. Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in Britain. He said conditions created by London's role as a leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries. Three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in Britain, Lawson said. First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest rates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets. He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party. Thirdly, he said "we do not have as long a track record of low inflation" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany. Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminent financial centre, because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than New York or Tokyo. REUTER

Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well clear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontline emirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat. "I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared this conflict will escalate," a top West German Foreign Ministry official, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after a tour of three Gulf states. b Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea captains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S. Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the Gulf. Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf would stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S. Action. But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the area. Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S. Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule. For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that it was ready for any further hostile action. Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guided missile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying the U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King.

Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but an earthquake early this month stopped that.

Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto, he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy. Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years. Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices. "We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy," he said. He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries. Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy. However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place. Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country. REUTER
ship	U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not place any restrictions on its actions. The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region. The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships. The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and Republican leadership as well as by the administration -- required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf. It did not, however, place any restrictions on the administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy. The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature. Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a first step toward a greater congressional involvement in formulating policy. But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the administration to address tough policy questions in the report. Reuter

corn, grain	U.S. CONSERVATION FIGURES SEEN NEUTRAL/BEARISH U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact. "Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in corn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for," Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert said. The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres. Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31. Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln. Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities, said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures. "The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing," he added. The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the enrollment figures. Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures. Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring, he said: "The trade was definitely looking higher, so certificates are going to be less than expected." The USDA offered a special corn "bonus" rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into the reserve. Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, said the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had expected, although she noted that some trade expectations were considerably higher than the actual figures. "I think it is friendly for the market, at least in the long run," she said. Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or the latest addition. "It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program," she said. Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation sign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60's. Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres. New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program, despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to final production figures.

crude	MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS Flooding in the Red River on the Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a 24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed. "The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week," a company source said. The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region. Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring oil which has been lost to the flood. "But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to." The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield Corp <ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> and Texaco Inc <TX>, which is the pipeline's operator. Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break. July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to 19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts. Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel. Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a barrel below WTI, respectively. Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area affecting the pipeline, Stevens said. He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded. The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was apparently washed away. The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this line. Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma, which is nearby. Reuter

corn, grain	CANADA RULING ON U.S. CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK The Canadian government is expected to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S. government and farm group representatives said. The deadline for a final determination is March 7. U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case, Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market. Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

money-fx	JAPAN CAREFULLY CONSIDERING MONEY POLICY - SUMITA Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar. Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year. Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said. Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices, exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan. Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said. The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said. Reuter
crude	TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel. "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugent said. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way." Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.

He said the rest of the 178,500 bpd refinery, including the 19,000 bpd catalytic cracker, was undamaged. The whole refinery was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the main units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said. But there was extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to gasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months. The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product from other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam, a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant. He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation. The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of its capacity since the end of January while an extensive overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where the hydrocracker is sited, he said. This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident. Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare line at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesman said this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident. REUTER

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last month proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200 contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900 contracts for any single month from 600 contracts. At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheat speculative position limits unchanged. "Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would significantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBT for speculative interest," Michael Braude, president of the Kansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC. A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing to raise CBT's limits. KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging efficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of the exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability to attract large speculators. The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same bushel amount as specified for CBT wheat. CFTC will consider public comments on the proposal until June 3. Reuter

crude, nat-gas	OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING MOVING INTO DEEPER WATERS Offshore drilling for oil and gas will be moving into deeper and deeper waters, according to Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co. and president of the Marine Technology Society. Geer told a press conference at the Offshore Technology Conference that the technology existed to drill exploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water. But he added that as the industry moves more and more to floating systems as opposed to fixed bottom supported structures, the financial risks involved were greater. He said such projects involved six to nine year time frames, and there was a "reluctance for people to stick their necks too far out." Shell holds the world record for the deepest exploratory well, at 6,900 feet, in the Wilmington Canyon in the Atlantic offshore New Jersey in 1984. The company is currently drilling a 6,700 foot well in the Atwater Valley in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Louisiana. Meanwhile, Brazil's Petrobras set a world record for underwater production when they brought a well in 1,350 feet of water offshore Rio de Janeiro state into production in January. Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the Green Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of companies, including Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell <RD>, Dupont Co's <DD> Conoco Inc, USX Corp's <X> Marathon Oil Co, Standard Oil Co <SRD> and <Placid Oil Co>, are working, many of them testing new deep-water technologies. Of particular interest is the controversial Penrod-72 system being operated by the Dallas-based Hunt brothers who last year placed Placid Oil under bankruptcy court protection in order to avoid foreclosures on its valuable oil properties. They have been seeking the right to use assets to drill oil wells in the Green Canyon through Penrod, arguing that continued development of the project is essential to their ability to get out of their financial crisis. Earlier this month, the Hunts were granted permission by a bankruptcy court to pursue the Green Canyon project. The Penrod system involves a controversial floating production platform with well heads sitting 1,350 feet down on the ocean floor. Some 24 wells will be attached to the wellhead, with one satellite well sitting in a record 1,700 feet of water. Geer said he could not comment on the Penrod project, other than to note that it involves so many new technologies, it might have a problem fitting all the pieces together within a specific time frame. He also said he believed the potential production from the project could be in line with what the Hunt Brothers have projected . The Hunts' creditor banks have contended the Hunts have exaggerated the potential of the project. "They're in the ballpark," he said, of the numbers, adding that he did not have enough information to comment further. Reuter

crude	ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

Karlsruhe water authorities said a queue of about 70 ships had formed between the towns of Speyer and Iffezheim but most shipping companies had unloaded cargoes and were using alternative means of transport.

ship	PANAMA CANAL OFFICIAL CONFIRMS NO 1988 TOLL RISE Panama Canal toll charges will not rise in the year to end-September 1988, despite last October's landslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into the waterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said. He told a press conference that in confirming the Commission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988, he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989. The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in the current financial year but this could be carried over and met from next year's revenues. This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which cost the canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This included eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being spent on earth-moving operations to prevent any further landslides. He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any threat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future. Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard cut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, adding that he expected the canal board to determine whether and when the canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest.

The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new "Silkworm" missiles at superpower flags. The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf. "They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil," one of the administration officials, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said.

money-fx	POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the mark. President of the powerful and independent West German central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year, government officials say. (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA) But no official announcement has yet been made, raising eyebrows in West Germany's business community. The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank. There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982. Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up. Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980. In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century. But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate. "I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in West Germany," he told business journalists in Frankfurt recently. Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy. "Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external economy," she said. An economist at a German bank, who declined to be identified, said "If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply." One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to persuade the United States to stop "talking down" the dollar. For Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies. The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact. "This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they don't know - what the central banks can do," Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round, making a speculator's position worthless. Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career. A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker. He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf. Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced. "But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment," he said. Bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled. "They've burnt the fingers of many people," he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes, the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit. REUTER
crude, ship	BRAZILIAN TROOPS TO LEAVE OIL REFINERIES Brazil's labour troubles eased a little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing troops from the country's main oil installations occupied three days ago. The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil industry employees. Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their willingness to negotiate a pay deal. A national seamen's strike, however, continued and marines remained in the country's main ports. The marines were despatched to the ports after the seamen's strike, now two weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday. A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135 in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports. Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase. Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a sign that the national strike could soon come to an end. Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union leaders said the vast majority of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike. The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de Janeiro next Wednesday. Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator. Besides industrial troubles, there has also been considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector. On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies throughout the country to protest against high interest rates. Television reports showed some of these protests still continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana. The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a deterioration in its trade balance. On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to private banks. Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange. Reuter
crude, ship	PAPANDREOU SAYS GREEKS READY FOR AGGRESSORS Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea. Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens "the military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions." He said the activities of the research vessel could be aimed at partitioning the Aegean. "The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert," General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, told a news conference. He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning. Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area. The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey. Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus. The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover. Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a government decision that Turkey should protect its interests "because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in violation of international agreements." Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the vessels, he said "If there is an attack, it is clear what has to be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war." But he added "We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the military are directed towards protecting our rights." Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions Athens had attached. In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations "we will hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped with words." Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only "The Greek fleet is not at its naval base." Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek continental shelf. Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept it. Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus. He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied "Obviously, and perhaps even before the war." REUTER
crude	ENIM OIL SIGNS CONTRACT WITH INDONESIA'S PERTAMINA <Enim Oil Co Ltd>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <Southern Cross Ltd> of Colorado, signed a production sharing contract with Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina to explore for oil in the Lematang block of Sumatra. It was the second production sharing contract signed by Pertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986. The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presence of Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oil production split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour. Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mln dlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first two years. The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oil producing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials said there is a good chance of getting a high return on investment. A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilled before, was neglected because it is deeper than surrounding blocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have now made seismic survey possible. The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contract Pertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February. Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina's favour with operational costs deducted. Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil's production share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interest in the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it finds oil. Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude for refining in Indonesia if its share exceeds 150,000 barrels a day. REUTER

crude, ship	CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW U.S. moves to increase its warships in and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said. They said the American decision inevitably carries some risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington. "As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the Gulf could do serious damage," said one western diplomat. Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks on "soft targets" such as merchant shipping not protected by American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf. The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated by diplomats as low. However, "There is the threat that the Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers, will go for softer targets," one diplomat said. Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was "moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us." The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz. The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered to fly the American flag to give them naval protection. Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq. Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz. The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said. A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait. "But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti territory would be a very serious escalation" likely moving world opinion against Iran, remarked one. Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf. Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted last Friday "a river of blood" throughout the world in the event of any U.S. strike against Iran. Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself. Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets. Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added. Reuter

The walkout by Brazil's 40,000 seamen has idled 160 ships in various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters. The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma). Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without resolving the dispute. He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa. Economic analysts said the strike was of major concern to the government, which has suspended interest payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country's trade balance. The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted today as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.

The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the acres submitted, they said. Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week. However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total corn production will be minimal, they added. Reuter

crude	GOVERNMENTS SEEN MORE INVOLVED IN OIL DRILLING The offshore oil drilling industry will attract increasing numbers of government connected firms in the 1990s, according to Ronald Tappmeyer, Vice Chairman of Reading and Bates Drilling Co. Tappmeyer told the Offshore Technology Conference that contract drilling was reaching the same kind of situation that oil producing companies reached when their oilfields were nationalized in nations as Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia. He said local connections to the nation whose waters are being drilled was an increasingly important factor in the market. "We have seen contractors put at competitive disadvantages in nations in which they had worked successfully for years essentially moved aside to make room for locally-owned firms or a locally-built rig," he said. Tappmeyer, who is president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said how far the trend would spread depends on the growth of trade protectionism. He added that international contractors will increasingly find their role restricted to regions that require special expertise and experience, such as wildcat areas and severe environments such as in the Arctic and extremely deep waters. Tappmeyer also said he expects producing companies to provide the main financing for offshore drilling in the coming decade as banks will be unwilling to repeat overexposing themselves and drilling contractors will have difficulty providing financing out of cash flow. At the same time, he said he saw the financing as indirect as he does not see producers getting back in the rig-owning business. He also said projectfinancing will have to be backed up by work commitments to guarantee the payoff of construction costs. For the time being, he said there was a superabundance of rigs. But he said there will be a need for new, technologically advanced rigs within a few years.

crude	DECLINE IN U.S. DOLLAR MAY BOOST OPEC OIL PRICE The sliding value of the U.S. dollar may soon force the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise its oil benchmark price, setting the stage for prices as high as 22 dlrs a barrel by yearend, top executives with U.S. oil companies said. The current benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel was established by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at its December meeting when the cartel set a 15.8 mln barrel per day production ceiling. But the continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar, the currency used by OPEC for its oil sales, is making the 18 dlr price difficult to sustain, said Fred Hartley, chairman of Unocal Corp <UCL>. The U.S. dollar has fallen in value by about 10 pct since December and has fallen by a total of about 40 pct during the past two years. Hartley told Reuters he expected significantly higher oil prices this winter and would not rule out the potential for 25 dlrs a barrel by the spring of 1988. "I think June will be the critical month to see what they do," said Hartley, who was in Houston to attend the World Petroleum Congress. OPEC has scheduled a regular meeting in June which some experts believe is likely to revive suggestions that oil should be priced according to a basket of world currencies instead of the U.S. dollar. E.H. Clark, chairman of <Baker Hughes Inc>, said the Saudi kingdom's need to generate revenues -- rather than greater world demand -- would drive any price increases. "The Saudis have made committments and have a balance of trade based on receiving 18 dlrs a barrel for this oil. But the U.S. dollar won't buy as much as it did five or six months ago," Clark said in an interview. "I'm betting on the Saudi king's need to sustain revenues." Clark predicted that world oil prices would top 22 dlrs a barrel by January one. However, the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey reported yesterday that Saudi Arabia would not seek to increase OPEC oil prices unless oil demand showed strong growth. Saudi sources told the newsletter that the policy was based on the longterm need to restore the competitive position of OPEC oil against other energy sources. Many oil industry experts are forecasting a modest increase in world oil demand averaging one pct annually during the next few years. Michel Moreau, a director of the <Elf Aquitaine Group>, said he believed the worldwide oil industry had reached a consensus that prices of at least 20 dlrs a barrel were necessary to cover exploration costs, royalties and taxes on new production. The 20 dlr level will be reached this year only if the cash-strapped nations of Nigeria, Egypt and Gabon refrain from discounting oil prices or increasing production levels, Moreau said. "I think if more than two (OPEC nations) defect, the production agreement will fall apart," he said. "But this threat is the Saudis' big stick to keep producers in line. Nobody wants a repeat of the collapse that occurred in 1986." Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp <XON>, told Reuters he expected prices would remain at 18 dlrs through the end of 1987, adding that 20 dlrs a barrel was a possibility. Other major companies are taking a more cautious view of prices, fearing that some OPEC members may yet upset the cartel's production agreement. "This is a year of testing," said Alfred Munk, manager of foreign affairs at Amoco Corp. (AN). "If they fail, there may be a price decline to about 14 dlrs a barrel." French-owned Total CFP's vice president Pierre Vaillaud said, "Demand is not going up very quickly, at best maybe one percent a year. You can't change the price with just one pct," Vaillaud said.

Grains and pulses (except maize) were sown on 6.7 mln ha, compared with 13.1 mln at the same time last year, it added. Spring sowing is off to a slow start, with planting two to four weeks behind schedule in many areas of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia, because the winter was unusually cold. Western agricultural experts believe the crop could still be good but heavy winterkill will make it difficult to reach the 1987 grain target of 232 mln tonnes. The 1986 crop was 210 mln. Reuter

money-fx	SWISS COMMITTED TO JOINT CURRENCY INTERVENTION The Swiss National Bank will continue to take part in concerted intervention on currency markets as necessary, president Pierre Languetin told the bank's annual meeting. He said the dollar had on occasion hit highs or lows which bore no relation to economic fundamentals and cooperation between all monetary authorities was necessary to prevent it breaching thresholds that would damage everyone. "We are resolved -- as we have done in the past -- to take part in concerted intervention to the extent that this is possible and desirable," Languetin said. Languetin said Switzerland had noted with satisfaction the six nation Paris accord on currency stabilisation measures in February, adding that it had anchored the principle of strengthened international cooperation. He said measures such as recent concerted intervention were useful in the short term. But he added, "The (Paris) Louvre accord can produce no lasting effects without a correction of the fundamental imbalances, without a reduction of the American budget deficit and without stronger growth in Europe and Japan." Languetin said certain changes would probably be necessary in the "too expansive" monetary policy of the United States, adding that there was a prevailing view that U.S. Money supply was expanding too strongly. "If this should last long the dollar could only be stabilised at the cost of a substantial easing in monetary policy on the part of the other central banks, which would in turn create the basis for a new wave of world-wide inflation," he said. One positive factor was that monetary authorities in the most important countries had not relinquished their anti-inflation policies. REUTER

grain, wheat	FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987 The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand. FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in 1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America. World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S. "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially on the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said. FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986 harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes. FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union. REUTER

"We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export target for the year," he said in a statement. He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the Soviet Union and Iraq. In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes. Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered to the AWB. The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said. However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said. Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's February Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes. But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes. The official estimate is not yet available. In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of the 16.13 mln tonne crop. Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000 sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB's receival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics data.

money-fx	EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT European Community finance ministers and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges. Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the informal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the February agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels. In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada had proved itself "more or less workable." But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the United States and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week. The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held to coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and Third World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week. The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow. Continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda. Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings. The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months. In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the EC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors. The committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January. Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the fledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over the mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met with a cool response in West Germany. He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls. Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in the Community. He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the EC's goal of monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution, instead of by national central banks as at present. Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by the EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field. EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusal so far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism. REUTER
crude, nat-gas	DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U.S. OIL INDUSTRY The U.S. Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said. "The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S. Congress on energy issues. Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee. Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed. Herrington said, "I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day (addition) to U.S. production." U.S. oil output was off to 8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last year, the American Petroleum Institute said. Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term. Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that "even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for the year." Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration. John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said "The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and U.S. government policy." Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time. "Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but would not raise energy costs." Lichtblau said. But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee. Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said, "The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation." The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil service companies. The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle. Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry. At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests. But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise. Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements "is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action." But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, "a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990. In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added. Reuter

He said the allocations were in line with Indonesia's production ceiling under its current OPEC quota, so they might be increased if OPEC ratifies a production rise next week. Allocations of Indonesia's main traded crude, Minas, had been cut by 50 pct and Duri by 38 pct, he said. Last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct. Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling. Oil traders said Indonesian grades were already trading above their official selling prices (osp) on the spot market due to strong demand from Japan and the U.S. And tight supplies.

crude	AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output, resources analyst Ian Story said here. A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference. Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd. Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said. The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-in production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue, he said. He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct. "The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs," Story said. Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development, he said. The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure. REUTER

crude	TASS DENOUNCES U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN AS ADVENTURISM The official Soviet news agency Tass denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would bring no dividends to the Reagan administration. Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels. "The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that the latest military adventure will not bring political dividends to the American administration," Krutikhin said. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs. Soviet officials have previously criticized the United States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their presence serves to increase tension. Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought broader contacts with Iran in the last year. Krutikhin said: "The United States has undertaken an act of armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has long been spoken of by Washington officials." Reuter
ship	JAPANESE SHIPYARDS TO FORM CARTEL, CUT OUTPUT Japan's ailing shipyards have won approval from the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash production to about half of total capacity for one year, effective April 1, industry sources said. The approval follows an act of parliament passed last week designed to help the industry regroup and shed 20 pct of capacity by March 31, 1988, Transport Ministry officials said. The cartel, comprising 33 yards capable of constructing ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes, will limit newbuilding output to a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes in 1987/88, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan said. Industry sources said the 33 will seek to renew the cartel in 1988/89 in the belief demand will remain sluggish. Last week's temporary act of parliament also allows shipbuilders to receive favourable taxation terms plus up to 50 billion yen in compensation for liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity. Up to 30 billion yen has been allocated for purchasing redundant land and equipment from shipbuilders. The Ministry will start drawing up its restructuring guidelines from April 1 and the yards will implement the guidelines from September, industry sources said. REUTER

crude	U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000, probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars. "I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000). Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," Hodel told the Senate Energy Committee. Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration. Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay. Reuter

grain, wheat	IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its latest monthly report. Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S. In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina, which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income, there may be problems in reducing production. A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited. Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems. The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries. They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long period. This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production, the report said. The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture, possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production. The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses. These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency. For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which most export transactions are denominated, the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure, the report says. The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to increased production in China and India. The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower acreages. In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S. Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

dlr, money-fx	BAKER SAYS DOLLAR DROP WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE Treasury Secretary James Baker said any further decline in the dollar against other currencies would be counterproductive. Baker was asked after a speech to the Pan American Economic Leadership Conference about U.S. policy in light of President Reagan's comment last week at the Venice summit that he could see some further decline in the dollar within reason. "All of the G-7 nations believe that any further decline in the dollar would be counterproductive," Baker told reporters. Following the Venice press conference by Reagan, the White House clarified Reagan's comments on the dollar by saying that the United States wants a stable dollar. The main incentive for the United States to favor a weaker dollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit, but the deficit has narrowed for the past two months and appears to be responding to the 40 pct drop in the dollar against the yen and the mark during the past two years.

grain, wheat	U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT The U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said. However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future. "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again," an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally." Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week. But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months. "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process," the aide to Lyng said. "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight," said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program. An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets. But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time. The administration's interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said. In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm, basic, factual economics." Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms. USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair.

In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season (Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln tonnes from the United States. During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.

crude	FTC FINDS 17 BILLION DLR COST IN OIL IMPORT FEE An oil import fee could cost consumers nearly 17 billion dlrs a year and undermine long-term U.S. energy security by leading to a quicker depletion of domestic reserves, a Federal Trade Commission study said. The study by the FTC's bureau of economics found that a five dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil imports would increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs a year. After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against the costs, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee would have a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year. Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10 dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cut the federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energy conservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil. But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs would reduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domestic oil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found. "Any attempt to increase our energy security by limiting imports will actually reduce our long-run energy security by speeding the depletion of domestic reserves," the study said. The five dlr a barrel tariff would also cut domestic petroleum refiners' profits by 7.5 to 10 billion dlrs a year, increase domestic crude oil producers' profits by about 13 billion dlrs a year and raise government revenues by 6.7 to 8.2 billion dlrs a year, the FTC said. Under the Reagan administration, the FTC has consistently opposed government regulation of the oil industry at the state and federal levels. "This study backs up my belief that government regulation and interference with competition hurt both the market and consumers," FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a statement. Reuter

dlr, money-fx	POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth. In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said "It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit." He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route. Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth. He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament. But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said. Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home. "A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth," he said. Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway. But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy. The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments. "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful," he said. He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States. Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated. All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said. "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues," he said. But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar's value could overshoot.

money-fx	CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS One or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, money dealers said. As a result, call money soared in active trading to around the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds. Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month. Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7 billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion. To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market. Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday, flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said. Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name, commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so. With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills, draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return. One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on Friday. Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said. "(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this amount," he said. "If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so." But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates, given the delicate state of currency markets. International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark. Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar. "The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular," the senior dealer said. Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism. Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between Germany's major employers and the unions, the Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said. Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business. REUTER

All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will counties which use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of Commodity Operations Division for the USDA. USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective immediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior corn would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts, depending on what the differential is. USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high posted county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices. "We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a month, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in any nearby time," Burgess said. Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf differentials when and if Gulf prices recede. "If we're off the mark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off the mark if we're too low?" he said. While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall, Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are being planned right now. "We don't tinker. We don't make changes lightly, and we don't make changes often," he said. Reuter
interest, money-fx	GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank's independence. But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl, president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said. Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors. "The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors," said one economist for a London broker, who asked not to be identified. Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time. "There are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling," said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister. News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad. Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market. Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under extraordinary pressures lately. Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability. In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices. Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his views, bankers said. "Poehl is in a minority in his own house," said Commerzbank's Pfister. "Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not entirely his own," said another economist. The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far, they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark and hurting West German exporters. The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October. Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases. Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986 war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S. Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports. One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990. But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for Stoltenberg than he had bargained for. The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year, had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts. The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising 4.3 billion marks. But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in. Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the country's worst political scandal. Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party. The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after allegations of a "dirty tricks" election campaign led to heavy losses for the CDU in state elections. Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide. Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt. When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government gave Poehl another eight-year term.

crude	OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today. In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: "OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs." But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases. "For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production," Al-Wattari said. "Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained," Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures, some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added. Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said. "A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation," he added. He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC. But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were insufficient in terms of volume, he added. "The overall majority of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's calls for supply regulation," he said. Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added. Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market. Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue. Reuter

ship	LAST-MINUTE OPPOSITION TO GULF BILL ARISES House Speaker Jim Wright predicted passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt. The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships. Since the administration made known its reflagging plans, congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted, and some charged the policy could lead the United States into the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq. The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf. The resolution was expected to pass without controversy today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution. Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the bill implied consent to Reagan's policies. Reuter

crude	U.S. ENERGY CHIEF SEES PROMISE IN OIL-TAX CHANGE Energy Secretary John Herrington said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to spur domestic production. The White House has said it would consider the option although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new tax code. Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year. The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday. Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance option: "that is one that could significantly increase production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer." He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to the overall U.S. economy. Reuter
interest, money-fx	U.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said. The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said. It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals. The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma. "On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively." At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures. In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the plans showed. The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts. They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S. And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national government agencies, the proposals showed. The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges. It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to "net" contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream. It recognised that "such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation," and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

Some said the makers were seen buying some 30 pct of their requirements, estimated at about three mln tonnes for the three-month shipment period. "Belief is growing that freight rates will not decline sharply from current high levels even in the usually sluggish summer season because the Soviet Union's chartering is seen continuing five to seven months from April," one source said. The sources said Japanese trading houses were seen covering a total of 500,000 tonnes of Chinese corn for shipment in May to October. But they are believed to have not yet sold most of the corn to end-users in anticipation of further corn price rises in the world market. Supply from Argentina and South Africa for July/September is still uncertain. But the sources forecast supplies from Argentina may fall to 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes from an anticipated 800,000 in calendar 1987 and from South Africa to 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes from an estimated one mln in light of tighter export availability.

dlr, money-fx	NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza," he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg," said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again," he said. REUTER

money-fx	FED GOVERNOR SUPPORTS COMMODITY PRICE GUIDE Robert Heller, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, said commodity prices could form a useful guide for setting domestic and international monetary policy. Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Heller said, "A broadly based commodity price index may be worth exploring" as a guide to monetary policy. "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, monetary policy might be eased," he said. Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement problems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give "early warning" signs of wholesale and retail changes. "There is no need to react to every small fluctuation in commodity prices or to do so on a daily basis," Heller said in a prepared text. "But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend, a policy action might be considered," he said. Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as an indicator for monetary policy would also contribute to stabilized currency exchange rates. Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices for them are more consistent than for other types of goods, he said. He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilize export commodity prices for developing countries by using a commodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy. Reuter

interest, money-fx	EYSKENS SAYS US PRIME RISES WILL AID CURRENCIES Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens warmly welcomed this week's increase in U.S. Prime rates, calling it a move that went beyond the Group of Five and Canada Paris accord on stabilising currencies. The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policy convergence among major countries, he added. In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear he believed the countries involved in the accord - the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - had agreed "tentative" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates. Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Belgium this weekend focusing on the international monetary situation and proposals for strengthening the European Monetary System (EMS). Asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets, Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving "more or less workable" despite what he called evident disagreements over U.S. Economic and monetary policy between Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Besides Baker's public statements that had dramatically influenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.And Japan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against the yen, he said. But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo could reach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. "I think agreement is quite possible," he said. Eyskens said he was "very agreeably surprised" by this week's quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite the obvious negative consequences for debtor countries. "It is a positive element which goes further than the (Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account of its content," he said. He added that coordination of interest rates was a fundamental element of economic and monetary convergence between leading industrialised economies. "A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuation ranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by a more coordinated policy of interest rates," he said. Eyskens made clear he believed the G-6 countries had agreed in Paris on ranges in which to hold their currencies. He said the end of the February 22 Louvre accord, in which the partners agreed to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels, clearly alluded to a "system of tentative (fluctuation) margins." He added the meeting and the statement would have been meaningless if the G-6 had not discussed the technicalities of implementing it. Eyskens said there was growing economic convergence among leading industrialised countries pointing towards greater order in the international monetary system. "That doesn't mean we are ready to restore Bretton Woods (the post-World War Two system of fixed exchange rates), but within the (International Monetary Fund) Interim Committee we are thinking in terms of target zones, fluctuation ranges to be implemented and defended," he said. The Interim Committee meets next week in Washington ahead of the IMF's Spring meetings, and Eyskens said the EC ministers would prepare for the gatherings at this weekend's talks. He said he hoped for wide-ranging talks on the future of the EMS at the weekend meeting, based on proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors for strengthening the system through technical and institutional changes. Eyskens said he expected EC Commission President Jacques Delors to submit proposals for fully liberalising capital movements within the 12-nation bloc and made clear he shared Delors' view that this must be accompanied by a reinforcement of the EMS. "Both are totally linked. Liberalisation without strengthening the EMS would destabilise the Community," he said. REUTER

He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the six nations have taken measures, including market intervention, to support the dollar above that level. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates. Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of each nation since the February 22 Paris accord, he said he did not think the fundamentals themselves had changed substantially. But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is happening in major nations. He did not elaborate. Miyazawa added that it was difficult to say why there has been such speculative dollar selling in the market. REUTER

crude	VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50,000 BPD OF CRUDE Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today. He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a visit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in August. Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to offsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week. Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao was put out of action. Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses. Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs. The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries. "If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this country would have ground to a halt," he said. Reuter

ship	STRIKING BRAZILIAN SEAMEN HOLD PAY TALKS Striking Brazilian seamen, who say they have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports, today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour Minister Almir Pazzianotto, union officials said. Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talks would lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday. Brazil's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct. The union official said the strike had halted a total of 158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil's main port, Santos, and about 50 more in Rio de Janeiro. Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said. Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern to the government, which has already had to suspend interest payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country's trade balance. The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted in today's Gazeta Mercantil newspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports. "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it is not conceivable that exports be hit," he said. "But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we are going to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad, and all this through the fault of the seamen," Rubens Habbema said. A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been the scene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, said movement of ships out of the port was running at about half its normal level of 12 ships a day. He said a total of 76 ships were either waiting at anchor on moored in the harbour. Reuter

dlr, money-fx	DOLLAR/YEN INTERVENTION RESPONDS TO PRESSURE The Bank of France intervened to buy small amounts of dollars and sell yen in Paris today to stabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month's meeting of Finance Ministers of the Group of Five and Canada, foreign exchange dealers said. But they said recent central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to temporary pressures rather than a major defence operation. A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sources close to the central bank said it had also intervened yesterday. Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with the Bundesbank and Bank of Japan. The sources said the French central bank could have been in the market again today in two-way operations, not necessarily on its own account, but to counter short-term pressures arising from the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31. One major French bank said it bought between five and 15 mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to the dollar. Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of France to say it was in the market, a departure from the central bank's usual insistence on confidentiality. But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention, which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale. "Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you would still be talking of a small overall amount," said one dealer. Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly to have been required to meet year-end window dressing demand for yen. "This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a wider trend," the dealer said. Operators have been extremely cautious about testing the dollar's trading ranges against the West German mark and Japanese yen. These ranges were set in February's stabilisation agreement reached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and the Finance Ministers of Japan, Germany, France, Britain and Canada. But speculative pressures started to build again this week after Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend as repeating earlier statements that Washington had no target for the dollar. Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talking the dollar down, telling a Cable News Network interviewer and a Senate committee he stood by the Paris agreement. Foreign exchange markets had been misreading his comments, he said. REUTER
crude	ECUADOR SAYS SUSPENDS OIL EXPORTS DUE EARTHQUAKE Ecuador today suspended its crude oil exports indefinitely due to an earthquake last night that damaged pumping and crude transport installations, an Energy and Mines MInistry statement said. It said the state oil firm Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana (CEPE) notified foreign customers that it was declaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor. Ecuador"s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day (bpd). A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping station at El Salado on Ecuador's main pipeline was damaged. He also said an 180 metre section of the pipeline attached to the bridge over the Aguarico river collapsed. The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventador volcano, near the epicentre of the quake, which Ecuadorean seismologists said registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The Aguarico bridge was also close to the volcano, he said. The quake struck northern Ecaudor and southern Colombia, according to Ecuadorean officials. No injuries were reported. REUTER

interest, money-fx	BANK OF FRANCE LAUNCHES MONEY MARKET TENDER The Bank of France said it set a money market intervention tender today to inject funds to the market against first category paper. Money market sources said the surprise announcement might herald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank intervention rate from the 7-3/4 pct level set March 10, but they added such a cut was relatively unlikely. The intervention rate was cut from eight pct on March 10 after being raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 to head off speculative pressure against the franc. Dealers said market fundamentals could justify a further easing, but a combination of technical factors and renewed currency uncertainties surrounding the dollar had put short-term upside pressure on interest rates in recent sessions. Call money rose yesterday to 7-7/8 eight pct from 7-3/4 7/8 pct. Today it was first indicated at 8-1/8 1/4 before easing on news of the tender to 7-13/16 7/8 pct.

interest, money-fx	BELGIUM SAYS U.S PRIME RISES WILL AID CURRENCIES Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens warmly welcomed this week's increase in U.S. Prime rates, calling it a move that went beyond the Group of Five and Canada Paris accord on stabilising currencies. The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policy convergence among major countries, he added. In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear he believed the countries involved in the accord -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada -- had agreed "tentative" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates. Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Belgium this weekend focusing on the international monetary situation and proposals for strengthening the European Monetary System (EMS). Asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets, Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving "more or less workable" despite what he called evident disagreements over U.S. Economic and monetary policy between Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Besides Baker's public statements that had dramatically influenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.And Japan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against the yen, he said. But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo could reach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. "I think agreement is quite possible," he said. Eyskens said he was "very agreeably surprised" by this week's quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite the obvious negative consequences for debtor countries. "It is a positive element which goes further than the (Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account of its content," he said. He added that coordination of interest rates was a fundamental element of economic and monetary convergence between leading industrialised economies. "A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuation ranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by a more coordinated policy of interest rates," he said. Reuter

money-fx	NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND THE NAIRA Nigeria's Central Bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency, which has depreciated steadily. The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction. This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower "marginal" rate, analysts said. "It should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered," a Western diplomat commented. The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM), began last September 26. At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at 4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row. "They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend," the diplomat said. The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2. It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday's scheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction. Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira. If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective of the new system, analysts said. Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the lowest successful bid. SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustment program, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in Black Africa. The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising imports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy. The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards. Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria, said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions. "So far so good" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos, adding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit. Fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect, he said. Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira's black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last September. REUTER
