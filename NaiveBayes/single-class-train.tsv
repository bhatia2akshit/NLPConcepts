trade	NAKASONE HOPES U.S. VISIT WILL HELP END TRADE ROW Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said he hopes his visit to Washington later this week will help resolve Japan's severe trade problems with the United States. Nakasone leaves on his sixth official visit to the United States on Wednesday, only weeks after President Reagan imposed punitive tariffs of 300 mln dlrs a year on Japanese electronic goods for alleged violation of a semiconductor pact. Japan also faces more possible sanctions amid calls in the U.S. Congress for further action to help improve trade imbalances. Japan's trade surplus with the United States reached a record 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986. Nakasone told reporters that special envoy Shintaro Abe, who has just returned from Washington, told him protectionist sentiment in the United States is severe. "We are well aware of a movement in the United States to enact legislation," Nakasone said. He said friends at home and abroad have advised him not to go to the United States but it is now more important than ever that he express Japan's view and carefully listens to the views of the United States. "My visit to the United States at this time will be the most important visit of all," Nakasone said. While in Washington, he said he hopes to have candid and frank discussions with President Reagan and Congressionl leaders. He said he plans to discuss exchange rate stability, economic cooperation to developing countries and U.S.-Soviet disarmament and arms control. On the recently imposed trade sactions, Nakasone said he would present evidence that Japanese semiconductor imports are increasing and that Japan is monitoring exports to third countries. "We have full confidence we can present clear evidence," he said. "(Therefore), we will request that the sanctions be lifted at the earliest possible time." On the trade imbalance, Nakasone said Japan has already taken action. The volume of exports to the United States has been cut, while U.S. Imports have increased. But Japanese imports from Europe and other Asian nations have recently surged, those from the United States remain weak, indicating a lack of U.S. Competitiveness, he said. Nakasone said Japan will continue to strive to improve the trade imbalance but the United States will have to become more competitive and improve its huge budget deficit. He said he will also discuss the forthcoming Venice summit of the seven major industrial nations in June. "We can further enhance the efforts for improving peace, disarmament and the world economies as a whole through solidarity," Nakasone said. REUTER
money-fx	LAWSON SAYS U.K. ELECTION NOT ONLY EMS BAR British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the only element standing in the way of full British membership of the European Monetary System (EMS). But he added that arguments against joining had weakened. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest. But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers' meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership. In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism, there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered, he said. British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system, he noted. "We have to make sure it would work." But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem. As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency, which he said was diminishing. "That argument has clearly weakened," he said. Lawson restated that the government was keeping the question of membership under review. REUTER

trade	YEUTTER SEES GATT CONSENSUS ON FARM TRADE REFORM U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September. Yeutter said "at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely." There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and "a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there," Yeutter said. However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said. "It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy," he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said. Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said "one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package." REUTER

money-fx	TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS The Louvre accord on currency stability, which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since last February, appeared in serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to the boil, foreign exchange dealers said. But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates. "That's not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington," Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact. Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S. Agreed to stop talking the dollar down. However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord. "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currency analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said. But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine view, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on." French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for "a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit." Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury commented on the row. But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre Accord." In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S. Was still committed to the accord. In a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also stepped into the French money market to hold down rates, injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose close to eight pct. Reuter

A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washington laying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products. But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals. "I have nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current situation," Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun. Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market forces. "The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilise supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time," he said. Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.

crude	EX-ARCO <ARC> CHIEF SEES ENERGY CRISIS BY 1990 Dwindling global crude oil reserves and the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said. "It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," Anderson told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. "I believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find." Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about 4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear. "If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle East," he said. "We're soon going to be right back where we were in 1973 and 1979." Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb. "There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't enough supply," he said. "There have been no major oil discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years." Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said. Reuter

money-supply	FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to today." Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added. Today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous." "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein." "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar's progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy. "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on Fed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing." Reuter
money-supply	SIGN OF SLOWING IN GERMAN MONEY GROWTH -BUNDESBANK Central bank money stock was growing at about seven pct in the first quarter of 1987, down from 9-1/2 pct in the second half of 1986, so there are signs that the pace of growth is slowing even though it is still above target, the Bundesbank said in its 1986 annual report. The Bundesbank set a target range of three to six pct growth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 for central bank money stock. In the previous year it grew 7.7 pct, outside the 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 pct target range. The Bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 was limited by a series of external factors. These included the revaluation of the mark, growing foreign payments surpluses of non-banks, and currency inflows. The Bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshoot in 1986, as an attempt to counter monetary expansion with interest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upward pressure on the mark, it said. The lower end of the 1987 target range would be realistic if a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form were invested in long-term bank accounts or bonds, public bonds or foreign securities, the Bundesbank said. But if companies and private households continue to hold their funds in liquid forms, or if there are further currency inflows, growth will be closer to the upper end of the range. "The more the conflict between external constraints and domestic objectives relaxes -- and many things point to this at the time of writing this report -- the more possible it will be to do justice again to the medium-term concept of money supply control," the Bundesbank said. It noted that prices were beginning to tend upwards again at the start of 1987. There would be virtually no easing of other production costs in 1987 to compensate for the rise in unit-wage costs. "Nevertheless, no inflationary trends are likely to set in this year," the Bundesbank said. A link between excessive monetary growth and intensifying price rises can only be observed in the long term, it added. The continuing trend for non-banks to switch into long-term borrowing to take advantage of low interest rates, while for the same reason shunning long-term investments, increases the risks in changing interest rates for banks refinancing themselves with variable-interest deposits, it added.

Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters after addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, "By early in the next century, synthetics should play a significant role in this country's energy supply." McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range. "You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil prices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to be prepared," McMillan said. He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct annually in the next few years while the nation fails to replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher because of declining supplies, McMillan said. Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help spur development of synthetic fuels. The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that of all the world's known oil reserves. "We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels competitive later," Hall said. The average lead time for development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between five and ten years. Until last year, the federal government had subsidized synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a research program created during the Carter Administration with the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels of oil. The corporation was shut down last April when Congress refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.

crude	EXXON <XON> MAY CLOSE ONE FRENCH REFINERY Exxon Corp, the world's largest oil company, said in a published interview today that it was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close on of its french refineries. Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out the possibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in France during the interview. An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no specific refinery had been named. She also said that all of Exxon's opertations were under constant review. Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade journal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in Antwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy. Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the improvement in the European refining situation, its future profits there should be good. "Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of refineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the indepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products rising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior earnings," Mlotok said. "Just after Royal Dutch <RD>, they are seen as one of the highest grade refiners in Europe," he added. Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as these producers move further into downstream operations. PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export refineries. PIW said "sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere are expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European refiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last year." Reuter

crude	BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues. A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. "All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years," the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985. The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it added. REUTER

The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said. The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration Commission today. Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said. The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws. The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of each shift and then to walk off. Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with container movements most affected, but has not stopped altogether, they said. They said they could not say how long the disruption will go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements. REUTER

About 14 to 15 inches of ice were reported between locks three and four on the upper Mississippi River, but other sections were generally free of ice, the spokesman said.

Midland Bank Plc <MDBL.L> said it has initially allocated 500 mln stg for home loans at this rate, while Lloyds Bank Plc <LLOY.L> will offer 300 mln stg. Earlier this week, Midland said it would cut its standard rate of mortgage payment to 11.5 pct from April 1, following a half a percentage point reduction in leading banks' base lending rates from 11 pct. Building society and other bank mortgage rates are largely still well above the new base rate level, although last year Lloyds offered a fixed rate of 9.9 pct on certain home loans. A Midland spokesman said his bank calculated that at the current level of 2.7 billion stg, its existing mortgage book accounts for about 5 pct of the total British home loan market. Lloyds said it has 3.6 billion stg in outstanding mortgage loans, but had not estimated its total market share.

trade	NAKASONE SOUNDS CONCILIATORY NOTE IN CHIP DISPUTE Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips. "Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected," he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying. While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute. Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact. That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips. Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura, who earlier today said Japan was ready to take "appropriate measures" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue. But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the United States to GATT, the Geneva-based international organization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed the tariffs. Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article 23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel to consider the legality of the U.S. Action. But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. "It may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United States may lift its decision at an early date," Tamura said. In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world markets and had opened up its own market to imports. Japanese government officials said they are confident they can make the pact work. They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output. While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese imports of American chips, MITI officials said that the ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens. The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users, some of whom are also leading producers, to step up their purchases of foreign semiconductors. A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans in the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to do likewise.

interest	LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability. Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said central banks would continue to intervene "as and when necessary." He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday. Lawson said he was still worried about the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament. "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is still a risk," he said. Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States." Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit. "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year," Lawson said. The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention. Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness." Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson said, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant." He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that "current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been "carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean the same thing," he said. Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement. Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand. They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year.

The committee said the refinery's future looked bleak because the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness was expected to worsen unless it invested, and because of the effects of a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content. But BP said the unit, in which Sweden's <OK Petroleum AB> has a 22 pct stake, had performed well both technically and financially up to and including the first quarter of 1987. Current restrictions on sulphur emissions and known future plans for both Sweden and export markets did not cause it any serious problems, it said in a statement.

trade	CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD World Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread throughout the industrial world. But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war. Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth. "We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn't close at the same time," he said. He said the U.S. action against Japan was "a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy." The interview came just before next week's semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium, Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched. He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform. The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment and reducing government's role in the economy. "We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect, however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio," Conable said. He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time. He noted, "the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt." Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October, 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank. Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next several weeks. He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency. the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities. "I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow," Conable said. However, he said "I don't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose." He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis. Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues. On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that "I don't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development." He added, "so I don't feel a great calling to personalize the institution." On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development Association was earmarked for Africa. Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings. Reuter

gold	PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING A proposed sales tax on gold transactions could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press conference. "If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions, Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business," he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would be unable to compete in the international market, he added. "How can the government really raise taxes if the system they impose is prohibitive of generating business?" he said. The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said. The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades, gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as that of jewellery and coins, dealers said. However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said. Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986. A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early 1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said. Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said. While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said. Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said. Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers said. Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign participant. Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers said. "All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax," Hofer said. "I don't think it fits the philosophy of an internationalising market," he added. Officials of several major Japanese trading houses, attending the press conference, said they supported Credit Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax. REUTER

It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' efforts to achieve further firming of the price has led to growing inflationary pressures in the U.S. Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed central bank limits and real growth of their gross national products, it added. Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank said. Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on futures markets, has also risen, the bank said. These factors and South Africa's unstable political situation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country, underscore the firmer sentiment, it said. However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90 tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986. Reuter

Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S. The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices. Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese. The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified. The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S. And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged access to the Japanese market. REUTER

trade	TAIWAN WINS REVISED TEXTILE ACCORD FROM U.S. Taiwan and the U.S. Have revised and extended their textile export agreement after negotiations in Washington this week, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said. Charles Chen told Reuters the original three year accord has been extended by one year to the end of 1989. The U.S. Has agreed to raise the limit on annual growth of Taiwan's textile and apparel exports to one pct from 0.5 pct for calendar 1989, he said. "The new accord is more fair and gives breathing space to our textile makers (so they can) diversify their exports to other nations," he added. Chen said the revised agreement puts Taiwan on similar textile exporting terms to Hong Kong and South Korea. But despite the changes, Taiwanese firms have lost orders to rivals in Hong Kong and South Korea because of the strong Taiwan dollar, he said. The Taiwan currency has risen 17 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the Korean won rose by some six pct and the Hong Kong dollar was stable. Taiwan's textile exports to the U.S. Amounted to 2.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last year out of total exports to the U.S. Of 7.8 billion. Textile exports are expected to remain the same this year, Chen said.

interest	BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity. The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets. Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth. "I think it's a good measure," a senior foreign banker said. "It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy." "It shows that the political will is very strong. They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run," he added. The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates. But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive. The government says industry's competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the European Community, which it joined a year ago. To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough sacrifices. Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose demands essentially involve more government spending, have become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can. Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard. The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct. Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months. The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and, inevitably, push lending rates higher. A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates. REUTER

trade	JAPAN DETAILS PLAN TO STAVE OFF TRADE PROBLEMS Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said. The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior LDP officials said at a press conference. LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19. Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month. Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated. However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials. The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by the government will probably include the purchase of super computers, LDP officials said. specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said. The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added. The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to and welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial nations in Washington last week, they said. The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be unveiled by the government in late May. REUTER
trade	REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS President Reagan today is to announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade. The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film. The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing. In his March annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities." He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to U.S. products. U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday: "we do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action." Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits, with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion. About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan. Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices. He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices. Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation. The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the results showed up. U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports. Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation. U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States. Reuter
ship	SEARCH FOR BRITISH FERRY'S TOXIC CARGO CONTINUES The search continued for a cargo of poisonous chemical substances loaded on the Herald of Free Enterprise Ferry which capsized in Zeebrugge harbour Friday. A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which were loaded on trucks in the ship's hold have been recovered, but Belgian authorities warned it was essential to recover a further 61 containers of a cyanide-based solution. A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at the front of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out. Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside the wreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on, roll-off ferry which now lies partly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour. The ferry's owner is <European Ferries Plc>, majority owned by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc <PORL.L>. The operation to right the vessel began yesterday after divers abandoned their search for more bodies. Experts said it could take months to refloat the ship and free the 80 bodies estimated to be trapped amid debris. "The problem is that in these waters you can normally expect one working day out of four," said Daan Kaakebeen of Dutch Salvage experts Smit Tak International of Rotterdam. He estimated the job itself would require 35 working days. Using reinforced cables, salvage experts intend to raise the ship and set it down into a trench dug alongside. Salvage work could pinpoint the exact cause of the loss of the ferry, one of three sister vessels plying cross-Channel routes from England to continental Europe. Suspicion at present is focused on the ferry's main vehicle loading doors, set close to water level. In London, Transport Secretary John Moore told parliament yesterday that the ship keeled over after water gushed in through the bow doors. He said a major government inquiry into the disaster will be held, all similar ferries sailing from Britain will be inspected and owners will be asked to fit lights to give warning if bow doors are not properly closed. Experts carrying out tank and computer tests to determine how the accident occurred will focus attention on the ship's doors, its ballast system and crew procedures, he added. Two other investigations into the disaster have also begun, one Belgian and one by the ferry's owners. REUTER
ship	CHINESE PORT UNDERUSED DESPITE CONGESTION NEARBY The Chinese port of Ningbo is working well below capacity despite being only 130 miles from Shanghai, which is seriously congested, a port official said. Jiang Feng Xiang said the port -- the deepest in China -- handled 17.95 mln tonnes of cargo last year, up from 10.44 mln in 1985, but well below its potential capacity of 32 mln tonnes. Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986. Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of its inadequate facilities, including a single track rail line linking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network. Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal from north to south China and imports include fertiliser and soda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks can handle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to 200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour. Most of Ningbo's port infrastructure has been built since 1979, official publications show. A container berth and two timber and three general cargo berths will be added during the current 1986-90 five-year plan, Jiang said. "The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995. By 2000, maybe, we will overtake Shanghai," he added. REUTER

trade	TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR FIGHT IN U.S. CONGRESS U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices. This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to "get tough" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products. On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's bill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects," but he emphasized there was a consensus among trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, "to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not done the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't avoided violating agreements." In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy. Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill. As an indication of his success, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still did not like some provisions. But he added, "Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well." The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation. Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free trader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a statement, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president." In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold off his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition. Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption. For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. Congressmen said the change would have required the U.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car imports in 1981. Reuter

Yeutter said Japan would be sending a senior official from its trade ministry to Washington next week for talks on the computer chip dispute. "We will be glad to have him here, but that's not going to affect a decision that's already been made," Yeutter said.

trade	EC COULD DECIDE ON JAPAN TRADE MOVES IN LATE MAY The European Community (EC) has effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said. They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26 to review the state of trade relations between the two sides. The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are "adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market." Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese exports. The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action. They said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves. In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods. Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March. Reuter

However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.

crude	UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS The "cross field allowance" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co. The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval. A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field. "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced. The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said. On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said. In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct. The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost. Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time. Reuter

Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now it is time to go and sell coffee." But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said. Reuter

trade	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. CONGRESS RAPS JAPAN The U.S. Congress is making Japan, with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around America's record trade deficit. "Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers to our exports," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said. "If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries," the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the trade bill. Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging bill is being readied for probable House approval next month. Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January. Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to press Japan to buy more U.S. goods. They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology. In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S. semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement. Congress also has been been angered by the administration's lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications goods, and financial services. The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign trade barriers and unfair competition. Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties. The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports. The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key Democrats to press for passage of the amendment. The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years. "I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken away from American business," Gephardt said. The administration has said it could not support a trade bill containing such a provision.

trade	U.S., JAPAN TRADE TIES REMAIN HOSTILE The visit this week by a special Japanese envoy has done little to defuse Japan's trade frictions with the United States, U.S. and congressional leaders say. White House and congressional leaders took a wait-and-see stance, after a series of meetings with former Japanese Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, who was here paving the way for the April 29-May 2 visit of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. They are withholding judgment until Nakasone's visit, with one senator saying Japan had promised to stimulate its economy and open its markets to foreign goods in the past, but it was time now for action. The U.S. trade deficit last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs, with more than one-third of it in trade with Japan. Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to try to turn around the deficit, which has cost millions of U.S. jobs and closed thousands of factories. Much of the anger has been directed at Japan. U.S.-Japan trade friction was further fueled by President Reagan's April 17 decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods in retaliation for unfair practices in semiconductor trade. Reagan said he imposed the tariffs on personal computers, television sets and hand tools because Japan failed to keep an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home market to U.S. products. Abe had asked Reagan to end the tariffs quickly, but U.S. officials said the curbs would not be dropped until Japan had shown it was honoring the pact, which could take several months. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked if Nakasone's visit might help to defuse trade tensions, said "whether progress can be made depends on how you want to measure it." He added, "I would expect progress to be made. If you want to measure that in terms of lifting the sanctions, that's more doubtful." Congressmen were equally skeptical. Abe met Senate and Democratic leaders active in trade legislation, telling them of Japan's plan to spur domestic spending by 34 billion dlrs and open its markets to a wide range of goods, including supercomputers and farm products. Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, said after the meeting, "We have heard promises in the past, but the question now is whether there will be real action." Abe also met House leaders pressing for a tough trade bill, including Congressman Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat. Gephardt is sponsoring legislation to penalize nations with large deficits and which are guilty of unfair trade practices. Gephardt's legislation would hit Japan, as well as Taiwan, South Korea, and West Germany. The bill is expected to pass the House next week - coinciding with Nakasone's visit - but its fate in the more moderate Senate is uncertain. A bipartisan group of senators, however, told Nakasone in a letter released as Abe was holding Senate meetings, that fresh Japanese-U.S. trade strife would erupt if Japan's markets were not soon opened to American goods. The signers included Democratic leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas and others ranging from moderate to hardline on trade issues. They said in the letter there was growing U.S. sentiment that Japan was fighting opening its markets and "evidence to the contrary is necessary to combat this perception, or it is likley that additional efforts will be attempted to close off the American market to Japanese goods.

Licht said. It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year, Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal. The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986. The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha, against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln. Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares (with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114 (118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44), Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138), Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany 385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52), Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136). Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows, USSR 3400 (3440), Albania 10 (9), Bulgaria 52 (50), Czechoslovakia 195 (196), East Germany 210 (205), Hungary 108 (96), Poland 460 (440), Romania 295 (280). On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88. Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln. Eastern Europe production could be 12.9 mln tonnes against 13.3 mln in 1986/87. Reuter
crude	MAJOR U.S. PIPELINE MAY BE CLOSED SEVERAL DAYS The operator of a major U.S. crude oil pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be several days before repairs are made and the system is functioning again. Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco Inc <TX>, operator of the pipeline through its subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs will begin in about five days and expects it to take several more days to complete. "At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get the job done," Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to assess because of flooding on the Red River. The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said. The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said. Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with customers to determine their requirements. Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices. Monday, after Texaco confirmed that the pipeline had been closed, West Texas Intermediate crude in the spot market and on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures complex rose 20 cts a barrel.

ship	U.S. HOUSE PASSES MIDEAST GULF BILL The House today approved a bill requiring the Reagan administration to report to Congress on its Mideast Gulf policy but not restricting its actions. The vote in favor was despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region. In the Senate, a leading Republican senator, former Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark Hatfield of Oregon, said he would try to prevent consideration of the bill. He said he will put a so-called "hold" on the bill until he finds out whether the War Powers Act applies to protecting Kuwaiti tankers. Congressional leaders complain they were not consulted about plans to put the U.S. flag on Kuwaiti ships and some charged the policy could lead the U.S. into the Iran-Iraq war. Conservative Republicans said increasing the U.S. military obligation in the gulf would place impossible burdens on American servicemen and equipment, and warned it could lead to war. "It is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will blow sky-high at worst," said Wisconsin Rep. Toby Roth. Reuter

The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last week. The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as punishment for inadequate documentation in previous transactions.

crude	IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter 1986, the International Energy Agency said. A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report. These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to fixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for fixed volumes over an extended period.

Contracts for Saudi crude have been signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings. The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut February production. It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd. The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter. The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains. Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record 1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected in February in accordance with government curtailments of approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.

trade	BRITISH MINISTER SAYS HE WARNED TOKYO OF SANCTIONS A British minister said he had given the Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its internal markets "and it was clearly understood." Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were beginning to appreciate the need to be "fair and open" about access to their own markets. At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty-handed. "I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very clearly, and it has been clearly understood." Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in Britain. "It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing them to carry out other kinds." "I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use them." He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship. "I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets." On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case. He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday, he said. Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan, but would have to coordinate action with its European Community partners. Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as it has threatened.

interest	WOJNILOWER SEES DROP IN U.S. INTEREST RATES The Federal Reserve will promote lower interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth, First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said. As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national U.S. economic policy. "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and, because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report. "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants have seen little to fear," Wojnilower said. He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts. Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.

The White House has said it would consider the option although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new tax code. Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year. The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday. Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance option: "that is one that could significantly increase production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer."

Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of consumption. He said the Saudis reported they would no longer accept letters of credit from the Bank of Brazil or even from Saudi banks and that Brazil would have to obtain credit guarantees from leading international banks. In February, Brazil had contracted to buy 125,000 bpd from the Saudis until June. Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship...I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere," Santana added. Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. The Saudis had put similar conditions on a previous shipment, he added.

crude	INDONESIA OIL CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS END THIS MONTH Negotiations between Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina and foreign oil contractors on extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract will be concluded by the end of this month, a Pertamina official said. Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina's foreign contractors coordinating board, gave no details about the outcome of the talks. But Pertamina President Abdul Rachman Ramly has said priority will be given to extending contracts for companies whose exploration and production contracts expire within the next seven to 10 years. Jukardi, speaking to Indonesian reporters, said the negotiations would determine whether the 85-15 production sharing split in favour of Pertamina would be adhered to or altered in some cases as oil companies are asking for. Hardjoko Seputro, spokesman for the Mines and Energy Ministry, has said that President Suharto has agreed in principle to extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract to reflect better current depressed conditions on the international oil market.

money-fx	G-7 SEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP CURRENCY PACT International monetary officials will rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets, economists and currency traders said. "I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets. It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down," said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp. In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed. His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send the already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a tailspin. The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about 1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen.

interest	LUX FRANC BOND MARKET STALLED BY BELGIAN CRISIS The thriving market in Luxembourg franc bond issues has been temporarily stalled by the Belgian government crisis which has put the franc under pressure and forced up interest rates, banking sources said. On Monday, King Baudouin accepted the resignation of Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' coalition and asked him to try to form a new government. Because of the crisis, Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA (BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourg francs, originally scheduled for the end of last week, BGL director Robert Sharfe said. He said the issue would probably go ahead later this week. It is likely there will be an upward adjustment in interest rates on Luxembourg franc bond private placements, banking sources said. However, no new placements are scheduled for another 10 days. The latest issue last Friday for Swedish Export Credit Corp (SEK) carried a coupon of 7-1/2 pct, whereas in previous issues the interest was set lower at 7-3/8 pct. Interest rates on the Luxembourg franc, which is in parity with the Belgian franc, are strongly affected by Belgian rates. On Friday, Belgium increased the rate on three-month Treasury certificates by 0.5 pct to 7.15 pct as the Belgian franc came under pressure. Private placements in Luxembourg francs have become increasingly popular, particularly with Scandivanian borrowers, because they carry a relatively low interest rate. Private investors also have flocked to buy Luxembourg franc bond issues because the franc was seen as a fairly strong currency. REUTER

trade	VOLCKER URGES QUICK AID TO DEBTOR NATIONS Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in laying the groundwork for economic growth, but a solution to world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new financing. "There is clearly a danger that adequate financing arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a timely way," Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee. The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them, he said. Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world economic power, but it is in a difficult position today, Volcker said. He said it will take a concerted effort to regularize Brazil's external payments. "The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilian authorities," he said. Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to work together, Volcker said. Regarding trade imbalances, Volcker said that it was critically important that markets be kept open by the industrial nations. In addition, the United States must reduce its budget deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their domestic economies, Volcker said. "We need time for those actions and the earlier depreciation to work their effects," he said. Reuter

money-supply	FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY U.S. banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit, economists said. "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Corp. Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct. Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously. Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the Fed had anticipated. However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week. First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs, partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes. As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed. Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late. Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so. "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day, equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct. After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data, economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's figures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture." Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar's fall gathers pace. Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

crude	MALAYSIA TO CUT OIL OUTPUT FURTHER, TRADERS SAY Malaysia's state oil company Petronas will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May 1, trade sources said. Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level. Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid-1987. However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510,000 bpd in 1987. The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks, the sources said. Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said. Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output. The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said. In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender, the sources said. However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the reduced scale of production, they said.

He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite. He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be considered.

Ecuador's oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador's account and remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at a rate of 35,000 bpd. He said Venezuela's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company never allows third parties to trade its oil. Reuter

"Japan has the means to make a major contribution to development in the Third World," he told about 500 Japanese businessmen and academics. "I would be pleased with additional support." With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japan could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries develop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said. Conable said additional commercial bank investment would also be to Japan's advantage. It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus into Third World economies -- notably those in South America, China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those in the developed world, he said. Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank's concessionary lending affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted. Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural adjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries to open their economies more to free competition and trade. "Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank loans) in the near future, though maybe not this year," Conable told Reuters after his speech.

Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition, said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34 mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and volumes and other terms may be rearranged. The agreement signed in January for the months from February to June is up for renegotiation. Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp <XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc <TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp <MOB> and Chevron Corp <CHV> 550,000 bpd between them. But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its obligations under the contract PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective agrement. John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate schedule although separate agreements with the companies would favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted liftings occur . "The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long haul," he said. Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely concentrate on volume rather than price. Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco. Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp <CHV>, Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB> and Texaco Inc <TX> but is now owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the ex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.

Chinese vice-foreign minister Zhou Nan and the EC's external relations commissioner, Willy De Clercq, signed the accord. EC sources said the office was likely to open in the second half of this year. In 1986 the EC was China's third largest trading partner, with Chinese imports from the EC worth 5.7 billion dlrs and exports worth 2.6 billion dlrs. De Clercq told the official China Daily that more joint ventures should be set up in China as a way of reducing China's trade deficit with the EC. The EC's affairs in China are currently looked after by whichever country holds the group's six-monthly rotating presidency, now held by the Belgians until the Danes take over in July. REUTER

coffee	NO HEAVY COFFEE EXPORT IMPLIED-COLOMBIA OFFICIAL A decision by Colombia to open coffee export registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply the country will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters' association, told Reuters. Colombia today opened export registrations for april and may, with the National Coffee Growers' Federation setting no limit. Since the start of the coffee year last october, private exporters were on average allowed 350,000 bags of 60 kilos per month. "Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcing heavy sales. Even today it pressured the market. But it will quickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to go over the top," Arango said in an interview. "Colombia's marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately. Colombia has no intention to give its coffee away," he added. Arango described measures adopted here yesterday, including a lower export registration price, as a major change in Colombia's coffee marketing policy. The export registration price, or reintegro, was lowered to 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock new york, or 155.83 dlrs per bag of 70 kilos, from 1.35 dlrs (194.33 dlrs). The government announced a more flexible policy of reintegro, in order to closely reflect market trends, which arango warmly welcomed saying private exporters will undoubtedly be more actively present in the market. A frequent gap between international market prices and the reintegro was unlikely to recur, he said. Reuter

interest	TRADING RANGE LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN DEBT FUTURES U.S. economic data due out next week is unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said. "People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve doing anything," said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman Mains. The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume, he noted. "We've had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people's viewpoints on interest rates," Mains said. The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the Paris initiative has made for "less than ebullient market action," Mains said. He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the trading range. "My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and market participants will see that current prices are unjustified," Mains said. Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks retail interest. "All of the movement occurs at the opening," afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said. Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward revisions in January retail sales and industrial production were "not real exciting," said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. "There is no one factor that will push us through the highs at this moment," Leiner said. Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market, said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan. Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month. Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed the largest increase since 1979. "The key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal," Kahan said. He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on second quarter growth. If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said. Reuter

gold	HOMESTAKE MULLS BUYING ORE RESERVES Homestake Mining Co is considering acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger told Reuters in an interview. Conger said, "the move to consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's acquistions policy." Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120 mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition, Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which have not been drawn on and could be used to finance an acquisition, he said. Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6 pct. Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces. However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400 ounces due to start-up production problems. He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400 U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987. Reuter

Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference the bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency. But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its war-battered economy now more than ever before. "We expect a common effort between the central bank and Arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed," he said. Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and budget deficits. Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in reducing demand for imports and increasing exports. "These are encouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet," he said. "We believe that with a just political solution acceptable to all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit the Lebanese pound and Lebanon." In the meantime, he said the central bank had four main goals: 1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit 2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bank financing institutions in financing the deficit 3) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreign currency deposits 4) to protect the financial health of commercial banks.

The decision followed yesterday's ruling by an Amsterdam court preventing the sector's employers continuing with current plans for 350 redundancies this year until the court sits again on May 7, Rosenmuller told a meeting of the general cargo sector's 4,000 workers today. The court ruled the employers had made a mistake in the complicated legal procedure for obtaining official permission for the redundancies, and therefore could not proceed. "There is no need to continue the strikes for the moment now the immediate pressure of redundancies has been lifted," Rosenmuller said. But he added that the strikes, which began on January 19 in protest against plans for 800 redundancies by 1990, could resume at any time before May 7 if the employers made any moves to re-apply for permission for the redundancies. SVZ labour relations manager Gerrard Zeebregts said they would be meeting their lawyers today with a view to re-applying for this permission next week in the hope of gaining approval for the redundancies within a month.

crude	ENERGY/HEAVY OILS The oil price collapse of 1986 put development of a vast petroleum resource -- heavy and extra heavy oils -- on hold. But as oil prices increase the long-term economic outlook is favorable, oil industry experts said. "Estimated potential world reserves of extra heavy oils exceed 500 billion barrels, of which more than half are located in Venezuela," Juan Chacin Guzman, President of Petroleos de Venezuela told the World Petroleum Congress. "And this virtually unused resource represents a prime example of the need to invest in technology to ensure tomorrow's energy future," he added. Venezuela had to reduce heavy crude oil output in favor of light oils because of economics and a very limited market. Not many refineries have been upgraded to process the heavy oils. "Improved technology has the potential for reducing the capital investment and operating costs of typical heavy oil development projects by 30 pct or more," Gordon Willmon, VP and general manager, oil sands and coal department, Esso Resources Canada Ltd said at the World Petroleum Congress. Crude oil prices fell under 10 dlrs dlrs a barrel last summer as OPEC members increased production to gain market share, but have since risen to around 18 dlrs because the OPEC production/pricing agreement is basically in tact. Willmon said light and medium crude oils currently supply 90 pct of world oil demand yet they account for less than 25 pct of remaining petroleum resources. "So future demand increasingly will be met from the various forms of heavy oil," Willmon said. Heavy crude oil resources include extra-heavy oil/tar sand, natural bituminous sands and oil shales (in sedimentary rock). Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oil development economical, including real and stable growth in crude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improved technology. He said he expects "all pieces of the puzzle to fit together." But he cautioned that the short-term outlook is very sensitive to crude oil prices. And he said the most important factor in development of heavy oils is the recovery of the price of crude. Willmon said the price of light crude must be about eight dlrs higher than heavy crude before there is an incentive for an oil company to upgrade its refinery to process heavy oil. He said the current price differential is only about five dlrs a barrel. Willmon indicated that a benchmark crude oil price above 20 dlrs would be ideal. But he said currently under study are a broad range of high potential cost-effective technologies for resources recovery, transportation and upgrading of heavy oils, which would permit commercial development despite a lower crude oil price outlook. Willmon said these technologies included enhanced recovery by steam injection and oil-and-water emulsion to reduce the viscocity of the heavy oils so they can flow easily through a pipeline. He said such technologies may substantially reduce current captial investment and operating costs. But he emphasized that innovative technology alone may not encourage new investment, that oil prices need to show a meaningful and sustained recovery. Most of the expenses associated with heavy oils production is fixed operating costs as in an oil sands project, rather than in exploration, according to Robert Smith, Senior VP Operations <Syncrude Canada Ltd>. While exploration costs for conventional crude oil range from four to nine dlrs a barrel, discovery costs for synthetic crude from oil sands are nearly zero because the location and nature of the deposit are known, according to Smith. But the remote location of oil sands deposits mean that everything required to build and operate the plant must come from outside the area. Willmon also said, "Public policy could best help by providing financial support to offset the high cost of technology developmemt which would help generate projects that could survive even at low oil prices for extended periods of time." U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said, "The Reagan Administration is firmly committed, without equivocation, to continuing our efforts to improve conditions and incentives in the marketplace that will spur oil and gas exploration and development."

coffee	PERU COFFEE CROP UNAFFECTED BY RAINS Recent heavy rains have not affected the Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative groups said. Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports, told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos) was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101 quintales in the year to September 1986. A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the crop was unaffected. Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation. Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts. He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales, assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO. He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another 235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO members. Reuter

sugar	EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS FURTHER CONCESSION The rebates granted at yesterday's EC sugar tender represent a further concession to producers' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc, trade sources said. They said the maximum rebate of 45.678 European currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 Ecus below what producers claim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention. The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of the level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week was 2.5 Ecus below this level. But the sources said producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that they intend to withdraw these offers. The French and German operators involved would be able to withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores. The five-week period is the normal delay between sugar going into intervention and payment being made for it. EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buy the sugar, it is determined immediately to resell it, a move which could drive down market prices further. REUTER

"I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm," Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which starts June 25. "We already have an agreement which may need only a slight review," Lukman said. The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement to keep the market stable. "I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to strengthen the gains we have made so far," Lukman said. He declined to say if the current ceiling should be maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December. "Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our collective will to keep the market strong," he said. He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this was significant for its members. Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year when OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and a restocking now for the winter was responsible for current market strength. Reuter

coffee	GOURMET COFFEE MAKES U.S. SUPERMARKET DEBUT Shoppers who buy Haagen-Daas ice cream, Dijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to the supermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitz for national-brand "gourmet" coffees. General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A and P, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are the only two national brand roasters so far to introduce the higher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets. But industry insiders believe there is substantial growth potential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales in regular ground roast types. "I would suspect General Foods will make a name for themselves with their gourmet line," said a coffee trade source. "What it could do is really dent the small-store, whole-bean business," the trade source added. The new lines are designed to appeal to a classic advertising composite--the "yuppie" consumer. They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine and were "first on their block with a wok," as described by Karin Brown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee, called Private Collection out of GF's Maxwell House division. Paul Gallant, president of A and P's Compass Foods subsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, described its potential appeal as "a status thing." At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it is expensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold in small specialty stores. General Foods' Maxwell House Div. has just cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs for 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate, according to an A and P executive. Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has "nothing to announce at this point" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does Hills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and fourth size market spot by volume with A and P. Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of General Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the market takes off. General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help push coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in the United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a 1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show no signs of picking up. Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee quality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing. "The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name of profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this was quality coffee," Gallant said. As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the brew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, "they turn around and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have a Coke'," he said. Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have confirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are aiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd -- the yuppie composite. "Where else are you going to go?," an industry source said. "Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There are no other markets. The only area that's not been promoted is gourmet," he said. In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet line could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular ground roast coffees produce. Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of green, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of roasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting often-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell coffee near the trade price as a "loss leader," a product designed to draw shoppers into the store. But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing structure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade discounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a special valve designed to keep the beans fresher. Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green beans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmet coffee are now almost three times the price of green. Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference. General Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test market surveys for Private Collection came back for more. And product manager Brown points to the success of more expensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in restricted high income areas and are now available in almost every supermarket in the country. A and P is similarly optimistic. "We think we'll do extremely well in the gourmet market," Gallant said. Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of Private Collection in selected high income areas, while A and P offers its 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'Clock Royale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.

money-fx	VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS Venezuela's central bank has ordered Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange operations with brokers based outside the country, according to a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters. The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's volatile currency market. The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international operations. The telex said the restriction on business with foreign brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela. In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to prop up the weakening bolivar. But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de facto currency control. "It is definitely a control in the sense that there's no longer complete freedom to operate," one broker here said. "Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction is towards complete control," the broker said. The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with telephone calls. He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs a day. "It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," he said. The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks. "We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's ridiculous," he said. "They've been on a rampage against foreigners." The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct reserve requirement. In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in bolivar futures, the broker said. "We used to have a forward market," he said. "For a small currency it was miraculous." He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S. Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free market.

The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years, started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not return to work unless they received a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners have offered a 100 pct raise, which the seamen rejected. "Television reported that the port was operating at full speed, but that's not true," a striking seaman told Reuters. "The marines are doing their best, but they don't have the manpower nor the experience to control the situation in such a quick period," he said. Port officials said the national halt had already caused losses estimated at 1.5 mln dlrs. Despite the presence of marines, there were no reports of incidents. Reuter
sugar	NY TRADERS EXPECT CHINA TO STEP UP SUGAR BUYING Trade house sources said China is expected to step up its sugar purchases following yesterday's steep drop in world sugar prices. The consensus is that the Chinese will buy between 200,000 and 400,000 tonnes of raw sugar. "China is short of foreign exchange and a drop in prices is usually taken as a buying opportunity by Peking," one trader said. Yesterday, prices on the New York world sugar market plummeted by 0.58 to 0.50 cent on heavy liquidation by speculators, disenchanted over the market's lack of rallying power. Speculation is that China will need the sugar for the May/July period. Reuter

money-supply	U.S. MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY, ECONOMISTS SAY U.S. money supply growth is slowing down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the Federal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have contracted in February. A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy was justified on account of weakness in the economy. M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs. The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs. M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3. With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say. M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of falling interest rates and banking deregulation. But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. "The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows at the Fed," McCarthy said. Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, "We have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's coming in a lot weaker than I thought." The economists were quick to caution that one month's data prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks. Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a slowdown in the business expansion. But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus. McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter progresses. "Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as they were a month ago," he noted. He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct. Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national product for the first quarter proved to be weak. "You'd certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past." There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to solve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to close the trade gap, Brusca said "I'm not prepared to be all that optimistic about the bond market."

crude	TEXACO FILING ADDS UNCERTAINTY IN OIL MARKET U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc's filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but opinions are divided on the impact to the market. "The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today," said one trader. "Everyone is talking about it, assessing their company's situations in relation to Texaco," he added. Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies under the bankruptcy filing. However, others were less worried. "The first paid will be the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the shipping industry," one New York trader said. "If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything," he added. Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co. However, others were less worried. "The first paid will be the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the shipping industry," one New York trader said.

Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco on an open line basis, he said. Another trader, however, described today's activity as business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in bankruptcy. Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins for Texaco's trades. New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for companies that are in financial trouble.

crude	SRI LANKA PLANS TO RENEW ABU DHABI OIL CONTRACT Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has decided to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000 tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials told Reuters. They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is now awaiting its approval. CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31 this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1 at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each. CPC officials also said the company agreed with the Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the government selling price. Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through C.Itoh. Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments. Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each. CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable. CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year. REUTER
gold	INDUSTRIAL ACTION ENDS AT SOUTH AFRICAN MINE About 8,000 black miners returned to work after a week-long industrial action at South Africa's largest gold mine, mine owner Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd <ANGL.J> said. A spokesman for the mining house said the action started on Wednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a go-slow at One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division of Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd <FSCN.J>. The action later escalated into an underground sit-in at the mine over the weekend, prompting management to close the affected shaft because of what the company described as "the creation of unsafe working conditions." Anglo American spokesman John Kingsley-Jones said the company held talks with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), South Africa's biggest trade union which claims a membership of 360,000 black workers, but failed to establish the cause of worker dissatisfaction. He acknowledged that the mine suffered a loss of production, but declined to give estimates. Free State Consolidated last year produced 104 tonnes of gold from 28 underground shafts. The NUM was not immediately available for comment on the action. But a spokesman for the union earlier told the South African Press Association that miners had been locked out of the mine at the weekend after staging a strike in protest against being ordered to carry bags containing explosives as well as food for white miners.

coffee	IBC EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN COFFEE EXPORT FORMULA The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when it reopens export registrations, probably later this week, exporters said. They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were closed in mid-February. To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed. However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets, and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the exporters said. They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed producer price. Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval. The sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of this week. "Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently closed down," one exporter said. However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss reintroduction of export quotas, sources said. There is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters said. Another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which, while not affecting current shipments, could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales. This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or three days of registering a sale.
money-fx	STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates. Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels. But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today. Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre accord, had been underestimated. Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners. "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord," he said. "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do not want to discuss that here. Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a "slight firming" of the yen against the dollar. And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar. "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market," he said. Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth. Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation. "And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress," he added. Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis. "You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem," he said. REUTER

"We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been abolished at all," he told Reuters in an interview. He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds. Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate. Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand. It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector, he said. Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months. In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

EC Commission sources said yesterday French traders planned to sell 775,000 tonnes into intervention stocks, West German traders 75,000 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500. Dutch trade sources gave the same figure for France, but estimated up to 110,000 tonnes offered by German traders and producers. The Dutch spokesman added, "The weekly export tender policy and prices are squeezing the European sugar industry, and this is the only way in which they can really register their protest. "These are desperate actions, but we believe that most of this offered sugar will be withdrawn within the three-week breathing space allowed." REUTER

trade	AFRICAN STATES AGREE TO REGIONAL TARIFF CUTS Fifteen countries in Eastern and Southern Africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by 10 pct every two years up to 1996. A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), which seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the north to Lesotho in the south, said the governments would make the first tariff cut next year. In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000. The PTA, set up in 1982, groups Burnudi, the Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker states concerned about the effects on customs revenue. The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely traded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items. Reuter

sugar	BEGHIN-SAY NOT PLANNING TO WITHDRAW SUGAR French sugar producer Beghin-Say is not currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at this week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say President Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters. The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders. Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has started to move in the right direction, but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention. But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention. European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources. Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it. A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade sources said here. This amount represents about a third of annual EC exports to non-EC countries. Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000 tonnes. Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders said. Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a step in the right direction. Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate. Trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future. One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got satisfaction.

trade	JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade." Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control Japanese traders. "The United States has excessive expectations.," he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time." He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market. Reuter

crude	DECLINE IN U.S. DOLLAR MAY BOOST OPEC OIL PRICE The sliding value of the U.S. dollar may soon force the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise its oil benchmark price, setting the stage for prices as high as 22 dlrs a barrel by yearend, top executives with U.S. oil companies said. The current benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel was established by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at its December meeting when the cartel set a 15.8 mln barrel per day production ceiling. But the continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar, the currency used by OPEC for its oil sales, is making the 18 dlr price difficult to sustain, said Fred Hartley, chairman of Unocal Corp <UCL>. The U.S. dollar has fallen in value by about 10 pct since December and has fallen by a total of about 40 pct during the past two years. Hartley told Reuters he expected significantly higher oil prices this winter and would not rule out the potential for 25 dlrs a barrel by the spring of 1988. "I think June will be the critical month to see what they do," said Hartley, who was in Houston to attend the World Petroleum Congress. OPEC has scheduled a regular meeting in June which some experts believe is likely to revive suggestions that oil should be priced according to a basket of world currencies instead of the U.S. dollar. E.H. Clark, chairman of <Baker Hughes Inc>, said the Saudi kingdom's need to generate revenues -- rather than greater world demand -- would drive any price increases. "The Saudis have made committments and have a balance of trade based on receiving 18 dlrs a barrel for this oil. But the U.S. dollar won't buy as much as it did five or six months ago," Clark said in an interview. "I'm betting on the Saudi king's need to sustain revenues." Clark predicted that world oil prices would top 22 dlrs a barrel by January one. However, the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey reported yesterday that Saudi Arabia would not seek to increase OPEC oil prices unless oil demand showed strong growth. Saudi sources told the newsletter that the policy was based on the longterm need to restore the competitive position of OPEC oil against other energy sources. Many oil industry experts are forecasting a modest increase in world oil demand averaging one pct annually during the next few years. Michel Moreau, a director of the <Elf Aquitaine Group>, said he believed the worldwide oil industry had reached a consensus that prices of at least 20 dlrs a barrel were necessary to cover exploration costs, royalties and taxes on new production. The 20 dlr level will be reached this year only if the cash-strapped nations of Nigeria, Egypt and Gabon refrain from discounting oil prices or increasing production levels, Moreau said. "I think if more than two (OPEC nations) defect, the production agreement will fall apart," he said. "But this threat is the Saudis' big stick to keep producers in line. Nobody wants a repeat of the collapse that occurred in 1986." Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp <XON>, told Reuters he expected prices would remain at 18 dlrs through the end of 1987, adding that 20 dlrs a barrel was a possibility. Other major companies are taking a more cautious view of prices, fearing that some OPEC members may yet upset the cartel's production agreement. "This is a year of testing," said Alfred Munk, manager of foreign affairs at Amoco Corp. (AN). "If they fail, there may be a price decline to about 14 dlrs a barrel." French-owned Total CFP's vice president Pierre Vaillaud said, "Demand is not going up very quickly, at best maybe one percent a year. You can't change the price with just one pct," Vaillaud said.

crude	OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today. In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: "OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs." But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases. "For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production," Al-Wattari said. "Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained," Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures, some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added. Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said. "A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation," he added. He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC. But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were insufficient in terms of volume, he added. "The overall majority of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's calls for supply regulation," he said. Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added. Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market. Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue. Reuter

interest	U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - PRIME RATE The prospect that other banks will follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit markets today, economists said. Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4 pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed. Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar - the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the news. Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate. Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this week, is already tightening its grip on credit. "The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the banking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I wouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data," said Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."

coffee	ICO TALKS ON COFFEE QUOTAS TO RESUME AT NOON Talks on coffee export quotas at the International Coffee Organization (ICO) special council session will resume at noon gmt today, following a last minute decision taken early this morning to extend the meeting 24 hours, ICO officials said. An 18 member contact group will meet at midday to examine new ideas, and the full council is to convene at 1900gmt, they said. The extension resulted from a last ditch effort by Colombia to salvage the talks, which by late yesterday looked perilously close to ending without agreement on quotas, delegates said. REUTER
interest	BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES This week's Bank of England resistance to strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct. But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources said. Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day. Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19. A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting. Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. "Even after this action over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking distance of that range," he said. Other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area. However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports. "If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they are, what's to stop it (going higher)," said John Cox, executive director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London foreign exchange market. Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped keep it below 1.60 dlrs. The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and 1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting. But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels. He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat. "If rates don't come down, the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling," he said. Most dealers agree there is a good deal of "hot money" being invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short notice. However, the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment. "The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and have to jack them back up again," said Richard Jeffrey, economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd. He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling, at least in the near term. However, most analysts are still looking for a full point about March 17, Budget Day. The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the Budget, said Temperton. The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets. "Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget. He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut," said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the equities arm of Mercury International Group. Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind. This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October. However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates. REUTER

The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years, started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not return to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners have offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected. "We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the workers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our protest until the end," a union leader said. more He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines take over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and let the marines handle the situation by themselves. A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national security. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has cut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle. Petrol station owners in four states also continued their shutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage. Reuter

MEES said government approval for the export pipeline followed a visit to Aden by a high ranking delegation from the Soviet Union, which will help South Yemen construct the line The engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly finished and construction is expected to start early next year, the industry newsletter said. The pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles) from Shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at Bir 'Ali on the Gulf of Aden, MEES said. MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity. The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms east of North Yemen's Alif oilfield.

Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations. Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40. "It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates," Sumita said. The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said. The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris statement said.

sugar	SOVIET SUGAR CONSUMPTION UP AS HOME BREWING GROWS A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption since the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost vodka sales, Pravda said. The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into two billion bottles of moonshine. At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said, this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree. "Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count home-brew," Pravda said. "The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier." Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first step to improving Soviet economic performance, which had been seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.

ship	TAIWAN SHIPBUILDER LOOKS FOR JAPANESE VENTURES Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim its debts, chairman Louis Lo said. He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint production venture, to build two hulls for <Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T>, he said. Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi, which would complete production. "We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said. He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea. Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs. But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery. "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification," he said. Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87. CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said. Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship repairing was bright. REUTER
coffee	COLOMBIA'S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE Colombia intends to improve the marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar Gaviria said. Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile. "In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that will allow private exporters to participate more actively in Colombia's coffee export policy," he said. Traders said this means the export registration price will change more often in a truer reflection of market trends. Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market factors since a return to a system of International Coffee Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short term. ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986. Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices with increased volume. "Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do so without an agreement among producers," he said. He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5 mln bags as mentioned in market circles, "because the idea is precisely not to disrupt the market." Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September 30. Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought to adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances. "There is great expectation in the world for the policies that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the immediate future," he told journalists. Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week. Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks have been resolved. Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the Brazilian stand was quite clear. He said Brazil's current quota "reflects the reality of the market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand," but added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that determined it. Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible, which did not happen.

trade	CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S. China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports," the editorial said. "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries," it added The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP, China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not be dominated or controlled by international Communism." The official said China was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them. China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years, which the U.S. Side won, he said. But, for the first time, China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT. "China has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT. "The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type," Shultz said. "China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation," he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidance planning" and economic levers. The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to do. REUTER
crude	ECUADOR QUAKE TO CUT OIL REVENUES 800 MLN DLRS up to 300 people were feared dead and more than 15,000 people left homeless by thursday's earthquake, which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleum revenues, authorities said. They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline at 150 mln dlrs. "the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is gigantic," president leon febres cordero said after inspecting the damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 miles from here. The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the presidential press office. The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific ocean port. Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of ecuador's exports. the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo province, health minister jorge brancho told reuters.

So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said.

crude	SAUDIS NOT SEEKING OIL PRICE ABOVE 18 DLRS - MEES Saudi Arabia will not seek to push OPEC oil prices above the current benchmark of 18 dlrs per barrel unless oil demand grows strongly, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said. The Cyprus-based weekly newsletter quoted authoritative Saudi sources as saying the Kingdom's oil price policy would not change "unless and until there is a strong revival in the growth of demand for oil." MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi price hawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources. The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on the long-term need to restore the competitive position of oil in general and OPEC oil in particular against other energy sources. "Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with its OPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint to maintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level," MEES said. The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeks of April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd). Output would fall in the last week, causing the month's average to be below quota, MEES said. MEES estimated overall OPEC production for April at around 16.8-16.9 mln bpd -- two mln bpd more than both its figures for March and Reuter estimates for March. It said Iranian production had risen by 500,000 bpd this month to 2.2-2.3 mln bpd, around its quota level. In Iraq, with an OPEC-assigned quota of 1.466 mln bpd, output rose this month to two mln bpd, not including "war relief" supplies from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the newsletter said. Nigeria, which has had problems selling its full 1.238 mln bpd entitlement, increased its output to 1.2 mln bpd, it added. REUTER
trade	CONSENSUS BUILDS FOR WORLD AGRICULTURAL REFORM Top U.S. and European farm trade and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance. Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production. "It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful," U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said. Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment. The need for urgent reforms is justified by the "imbalance and tensions of the world economy," the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said. And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he noted. Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas. Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses. Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices. However, "differentiated policy treatment is required" to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC, he said. "Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community," he said. Reuter
trade	TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U.S. HOUSE U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices. The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws. The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to "get tough" with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products. But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects," but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. The goal of trade legislation was "to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements," he said. In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy. Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill's provisions, but he added, "Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation. I think we are progressing very well." The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president." Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.

trade	NAKASONE HARD-PRESSED TO SOOTHE U.S ANGER ON TRADE Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S. Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim. Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S. President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said. News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier. It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips. Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth. But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day. Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate. But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan. Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures. He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament over the budget, political analysts said. Officials working on the government's short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment. They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half, probably over 80 pct. Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit. To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term economic plans. A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington. Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy, officials said. While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible, they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee's recommendations. A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct of gnp. The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993, from 150 now.

The walkout by Brazil's 40,000 seamen has idled 160 ships in various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters. The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma). Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without resolving the dispute. He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa. Economic analysts said the strike was of major concern to the government, which has suspended interest payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country's trade balance. The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted today as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports. "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment and it is not conceivable that exports be hit," he told the Gazeta Mercantil newspaper. Reuter

Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.

President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation but agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that opposition Democrats would pass such legislation.

Stevens said the increased shipments will make up for all crude oil scheduled to arrive in Cushing, Oklahoma via the pipeline by the end of June. The pipeline was shut May 30 because of an apparent rupture caused by flooding of the Red River, near the Texas/Oklahoma border. It was expected to resume service Saturday but rising waters of the river, which had recently receded, delayed the reopening, Stevens said.

They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank governors on a common currency exchange rate. The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year. The six states have different currency systems. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar. Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by itself.

World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193 mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it world market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said. Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold Eagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were in Europe and about eight pct in Asia. She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion coins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve the Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity. The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins, as long as this is available at market prices. The remaining gold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from the open market, Pope said. Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here from the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent from the South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf's West German market share at 60 pct. The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buy gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct value-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ounce coins traded today at 906 marks, they said. Competition may also come from new gold coins, including Belgium's ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australia also have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said. REUTER
money-supply	FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER Robert Heller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" of growth in the money supply this year. "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a most desireable development," he said in a speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange, Calif. A text was released in Washington. He said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished. "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest levels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid-January. "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well," he added. Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation. "The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future," he said. Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would "generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain more market share for U.S. producers. "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned. He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy." Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes. "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets," Heller said. He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada. A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with Canada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American producers to compete more effectively in that country," Heller said. Reuter

Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China could be a member of GATT before the end of the year. "They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member of the world economy," he told the House Appropriations subcommittee which oversees his agency's budget. Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of China's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip. The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade, would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for U.S. industries, he said. "That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S. business," Yeutter said. "I think China will develop into a fine market for us," he added. Reuter

trade	SOUTH KOREA TO KEEP TRADE SURPLUS 3-5 YEARS South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt. He said in an interview with Reuter that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position. He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs. Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products valued at 1.8 billion dlrs. About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases here were in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan. Rha leaves today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen. Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation." South Korea is a major exporter to the U.S. of textiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as television sets, video cassette records and personal computers. Its purchases from the United States include electronic testing equipment, grains and cotton. Reuter

crude	PETRO-CANADA TO DRILL TWO TERRA NOVA TEST WELLS Petro-Canada, Canada's state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland. Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said. Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said. "We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system," Petro-Canada said. The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984. "We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up additional reserves there," the company said. Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said. Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX. Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary office. Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added. Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said. Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query. The company estimates a production system combining both Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said. Reuter

crude	IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency said. Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day, the IEA said in its latest monthly report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct. The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said. IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said. Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March. And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Reuter

The tax status of exploration might also be changed, Herrington told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. He said the oil industry was experiencing difficult times internationally and had been devastated in the United States. Consumer demand and a significant decline in domestic production has resulted in a rise in oil imports of one mln barrels a day in over the last 16 months, Herrington said. "Steps must be taken...To reverse the downturn in our domestic energy industry and to safeguard and increase our energy security," he said.

The paper quoted U.S. Intelligence sources as saying the missiles appeared to be of a Chinese design known as HY-2 which is based on the Soviet SSN2 or Styx missile. Styx missiles have a range of up to 50 miles. It said the missiles had been deployed at two sites and quoted a naval analyst as saying they could be used to sink a supertanker and block the Strait of Hormuz. Missiles now used by Iran had only a fraction of the explosive power of the Styx and could sink a supertanker only with a lucky hit, the paper said. None of the new missiles had been fired yet, it added. The CBS television network reported on Friday that Iran had installed new missiles along the Gulf and said Washington had warned Tehran not to use them against civilian shipping. REUTER

trade	YEUTTER SEES GATT CONSENSUS ON FARM TRADE REFORM U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September. Yeutter said "at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely." There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and "a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there," Yeutter said. However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said. "It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy," he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said. Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said "one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to be as part of a larger package." REUTER

Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec. Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable juice processing with Imec. An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other details. The other two companies were not immediately available for comment. Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky told Reuters: "It all depends on France." At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986. Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with anybody with "interesting" proposals offering latest technology and assuring "a mutual advantage." He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting. He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws guaranteeing "the interests of foreign partners" in joint ventures. But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the new joint venture laws. He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng. He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods. Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union's food production capacity. Reuter

trade	JAPANESE TARIFFS SEEN AS WORLDWIDE WARNING The tough trade sanctions President Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide, U.S. officials said. But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings Institution, a think tank, said "a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern." He said it left the United States open to retaliation. The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws, and no new protectionist legislation is needed. In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights, patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a "serious signal" to other nations on the need for fair trade practices. Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers, television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer, Fitzwater said. Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit. The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would. The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about one-third of America's overall deficit. But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all. Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that "I regret that these actions are necessary," but that the health and vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets. "We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices," Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara. He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement. U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade. The White House aide said of the tariff action, "it wasn't done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade practice." The aide added, however, "on another plane, it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws." But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States, and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue. "It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route," he said, "because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade." Crandall said, "the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country, and therefore its impact on Congress." He said, "I don't think it makes a lot of sense."

ship	EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY As a British government investigation got under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship. Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover. Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed. Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present. "Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened," he told BBC radio. As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called "RoRo" ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise. In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads. Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety standards. But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design. Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge. "As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability," he said. Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level. "If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship," he added. REUTER

trade	GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS - U.S. A successful new GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient. "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round," he said. "The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems." The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said. "Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round," he said. But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years. "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two," he said. "They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future," he said. REUTER

"I believe there is room in the market for a further decline in interest rates," Reagan said in a statement as he left the White House to visit his wife Nancy at Bethesda Naval Hospital. Reagan's statement followed a meeting with his top economic advisers. Reagan said he remains concerned about the market, but that actions taken by the Federal Reserve have helped.

"We will monitor these developments closely and will continue to hope that they do not precipitate large declines in economic activity around the world," Aquino told a meeting of 13 major Philippine business groups. "The Philippines, as a trading country in the world economy, depends on the continued health and growth of both the world economy and the world trading system," she said. The Manila Stock Exchange composite index plunged 105.49 points or 11.79 pct by the midday close to 789.54, depressed by the record 508 point fall of the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday. "The Philippines, in addition, as a large borrower nation, is affected by developments in interest rate levels around the world and will carefully monitor the impact of these developments on interest rates, on gold and on commodity prices," Aquino said. "We welcome the statements from world leaders that urge calm in the present difficult situation," she added. REUTER
ship	U.S. TO PROTECT ONLY AMERICAN SHIPS U.S. military forces in the Mideast Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to "non-belligerent" states in the area, the Pentagon said today. "No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting all shipping in those waters," Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the protective U.S. military presence in the gulf. Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq. "As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are under our protection with the exception, on a limited case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the region," Sims said. U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that the the arms would not be used elsewhere. He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war. Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack. Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11 Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional ships and air cover are under consideration. Reuter

crude	TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN The oil services industry is on the verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil industry analysts said. The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half, and continue into the next decade. "People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying," said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>, Halliburton Co <HAL>, Dresser Industries <DI>, Baker International <BKO>, and McDermott International Inc <MDR>, which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor. Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S. "Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster," said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs. The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co <HT> figures show. The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. "The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988," Kerridge said. Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern, Kerridge said. "Halliburton is the best value," said Jeffrey Freedman, vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess, and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt. Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service stock. "Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry," Freedman said. "Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring, including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity," according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at Robert W. Baird and Co Inc. Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs. Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult. Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co. Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a pure service company, Sweeney said. Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup. Reuter

Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasil credit guarantees. Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr crude oil purchase from the Saudis yesterday after they refused to accept a letter of credit from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis had demanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leading international banks. Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they did not change their mind by Monday, Petrobras would negotiate the purchase of oil with other producers. The Petrobras statement said the shipment of 2.2 mln barrels will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled. The shipment is part contract signed in February for the Saudis to supply Brazil with 125,000 barrels per day until June. Reuter
crude	API SAYS U.S. CRUDE OIL OUPUT OFF FROM YEAR AGO The American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. crude oil production in February declined 9.8 pct from year-ago levels to about 8.3 mln barrels a day. In its monthly report on U.S. oil supplies and stocks, API said that domestic demand for petroleum products, as measured by products supplied, continued to rise reaching 16.3 mln barrels a day in the month, up 1.5 pct from February 1986. API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a drop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pct from February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S. production of more than one mln barrels a day. API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year's level. So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which was up 2.9 pct from last year's year-to-date level, has slowed in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of 1986. It said crude oil production for the first two months of 1987 was off 8.6 pct from the comparable year-ago period while crude imports were up 30.6 pct. Reuter
trade	JAPAN WILL ASK COMPANIES TO BOOST IMPORTS Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Hajime Tamura, will meet representatives from 151 of the nation's largest companies next week and appeal to them to do their best to increase imports, ministry officials said. The meeting was unveiled as part of a plan to boost imports and help head off protectionist legislation in the U.S. Senior officials from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry told reporters that such personal appeals appeared to have paid off in the past, as Japanese imports of manufactured goods have climbed. Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips next month in an attempt to help ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said. The officials also said they expect the government's new trade insurance law to boost imports and encourage Japanese companies to set up production facilities overseas. Under the new law, the government will insure Japanese companies who pre-pay for imports against loss arising from everything from war to bankruptcy of the foreign firm they are dealing with. MITI estimated that it would help solve Japan's trade problem to the tune of about $10 billion dlrs a year. REUTER
trade	BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM A senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system. Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate." His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports. Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks. Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods. Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs. "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he said. Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes. He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards. "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion." Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines." He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better." He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices. He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is to happen to the rest of us?" reuter

A bank official said M-3 rose 9.72 pct to a provisional 149.80 billion pesos at the end of December from a month earlier for a year-on-year gain of 12.72 pct. She said short-term bank lending rates fell to an annualised 13.88 pct at the end of December, from 14.58 pct a month earlier and 19.82 pct at the end of December 1985. Poor loan demand was illustrated by a rise in commercial bank reserves, the official said. The bank official said commercial bank reserves were 22.19 billion pesos at the end of December, when reserves required were 21.59 billion. She said the surplus of 597 mln pesos, compared with a deficit of 390 mln pesos a month earlier and a deficit of 1.64 billion at the end of 1985, reflected political uncertainty in the last quarter of 1986. Reserve money, the total available to monetary authorities, was a provisional 52.58 billion pesos at the end of 1986. This was 5.19 pct up from 49.98 billion at the end of November and 41.85 pct up from 37.09 billion in December 1985.

gold	HAITI ANNOUNCES FIND OF ORE-RICH GOLD FIELD The Ministry of Mines has announced the discovery of a major gold field in Grand Bois in Haiti's mineral-rich North. At a press conference yesterday, a Ministry spokesman reported the deposit contained an estimated 44 mln tons of ore, with each ton capable of containing 7,666 grams of gold. The spokesman gave no estimate of what he thought the find, discovered on Wednesday, was worth. However, mining could only begin after foreign partners invest eight mln dlrs needed for technical equipment, the spokesman said. The Haitian government has never before operated a gold mine, but the United Nations has recently completed a three year feasibility study which lists Grand Bois and Morne Bossa as sites of important gold deposits. In 1971, the Sedren copper mine in Gonaives, operated by a Canadian firm, closed down after years of mining a concentrate containing gold as well as copper. "The new Grand Bois mine represents large amounts of money," said a former official of Sedren Mine. "But like everything else there's a catch. The gold has to be extracted, and first someone has to come up with the money to finance the operation," the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. Reuter
interest	VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES Financial analysts see little chance that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week. "We got a little volatility Wednesday," said Staley Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. "But for the moment we're still in a trading range." Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state, the analysts said. "It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility," said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. "It needs something, but it's not going to be news about the economy," he said. Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy. But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said. In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace. "The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1," Quinn said. Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond market, he said. "We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct," compared to the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said. In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures. The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash government securities prices late Wednesday after the close of futures. "I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the trading range)," Lacey said. Reuter
crude	WILDLIFE UNIT PROPOSES ALASKA REFUGE OIL STUDY The National Wildlife Federation rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration. The federation, the nation's largest conservation group, said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called the Interior's research into the effects of development "so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision." Hair called the department's proposal a "reflection of a largely political decision," adding "we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area." Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen. It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration. Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain. Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development. Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct. He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas, fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration. The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years. Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to make a sound judgement. Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil. reuter

trade	U.S. TRADE OFFICIAL SAYS JAPAN ACTION FOOLISH A high level U.S. trade official said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor electronics products. Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate against U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce Smart replied, "That would be the height of foolishness." In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress in meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17. Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986. President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today from the two Democratic leaders of Congress. "I think it's about time," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House session, "It just shows we were right all along when we said something needs doing." Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing that last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S. negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts. Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States in these products. Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987. "It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I hope it will persuade them we're serious," Smart said of the White House trade sanctions. The United States has tried to convince Japanese car companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers. "All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them we can do better than our reputation seems to be," he said. Measured per car, each American-made car contained about 700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said. Reuter
trade	U.S. HOUSE PANEL EASES SOVIET EXPORT CONTROLS The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a threat to U.S. national security. The Democratic-controlled committee said the administration's export control policies, which restrict shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit. The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries. Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year. "This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more," the Washington Democrat said. The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls. Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments. It would also give the Commerce Department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly-sensitive technology.

trade	GATT WARNS U.S. ON FEDERAL BUDGET, PROTECTIONISM The United States' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said. By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual report. The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt, it said. GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years. GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit. Raising U.S. Trade barriers "would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however, increase inflation and reduce world trade," it said. "The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain," the report said. GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism. The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986. The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added. "Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year," the report said. GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar. "Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in turn, would adversely affect world trade." But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive. It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad. World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986, about half of the rate of the previous year. Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct, continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT said. Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while their imports increased moderately, although full statistics are not available yet, GATT said. The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia, Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports. REUTER

trade	JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said. "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanese government official said. "But we are also frustrated." The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress. "It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. "We have no leverage," one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said.

sugar	U.S. SUGAR QUOTA MAY BE EASED, CONGRESSMAN SAYS The United States may soon ease its 1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressman representing sugar growers told Reuters in an interview. Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House subcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated the easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about the impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year. "With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to one mln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean countries and the Philippines," Huckaby said. By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, the quota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons. Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September to December period "we could get away without having to increase the quota." He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an increase in the quota is justified. Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugar refiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials to request a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refiners said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S later this year, a refiner spokesman said. However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that it would consider the request. Following the refiners' request, representatives of the Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition to any quota expansion, industry sources said. The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from a sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of the current sugar program, indicates at least some grower officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the import quota, industry officials said. Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the Reagan administration's interagency sugar policy group. Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official said "As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota year is not under active consideration." Reuter

The Senate voted 93 to 0 to urge Reagan to impose penalties on Japanese high-technology products containing semiconductors in retaliation for what it sees as Japan's violations of the semiconductor pact. While the measure does not bind Reagan to any action, Senate leaders said its adoption would warn Japan stiffer legislation would be considered if the violations continue. "We want to send a message to Japan to let it know how the Senate feels about this matter," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd told the Senate. Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen told the Senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at correcting Japan's unfair trade practices.

sugar	INDONESIA SEEKS TO INCREASE SUGAR OUTPUT Indonesia will try to increase sugar output in calendar 1988 to 2.4 mln tonnes from an expected 2.2 mln in 1987, Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi said. He told reporters after meeting President Suharto the gains will come from increasing average production to 10 tonnes per hectare from the previous 6.2 tonnes. He said Indonesia is aiming to pass the United States to become the world's fourth largest producer compared with its current seventh position. Affandi said the increase would insure Indonesia's self-sufficiency in the commodity and allow it to keep adequate stocks. Indonesia said it produced 2.02 mln tonnes in 1986, but the U.S. Embassy in its annual agriculture report said output was 1.8 mln tonnes. The U.S. Report forecast no change for 1987. Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar late last year and in early 1987 to boost low sugar stocks. The country has around 284,000 hectares of sugar cane farms. The agriculture ministry estimates domestic consumption at 2.03 mln tonnes in calendar 1987. REUTER

crude	UAE OIL PRODUCTION DROPS TEN PCT IN MARCH Oil output in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) dropped ten pct in March from February to an average 1.05 mln barrels per day (bpd), mainly because of customer resistance to fixed prices of Abu Dhabi oil, industry sources said. The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buy Abu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs a barrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72 dlrs. The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAE producer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of 800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months. Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd from around 370,000 in February after the emirate declared a mid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, the sources added. Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaif and Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixed prices too high and cut liftings, the sources said. The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japanese term buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, they added. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of it Murban. Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came on stream in 1983, to be test production not included in calculations for complying with the OPEC quota. Without Upper Zakum, the UAE would be producing roughly its quota in March, the sources added. REUTER

money-fx	U.K. PROFITTED FROM AUTUMN INTERVENTION - LAWSON Britain has reaped profits by using a stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He said in a parliamentary debate, "I can now tell the House (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds." Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said. The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point. During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week, he said that "during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for." He said that that one percentage point increase, effected in October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two half point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct. Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and October 1986, government sources said.

crude	MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS Flooding in the Red River on the Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a 24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed. "The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week," a company source said. The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region. Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring oil which has been lost to the flood. "But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to." The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield Corp <ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> and Texaco Inc <TX>, which is the pipeline's operator. Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break. July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to 19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts. Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel. Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a barrel below WTI, respectively. Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area affecting the pipeline, Stevens said. He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded. The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was apparently washed away. The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this line. Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma, which is nearby. Reuter

trade	JAPAN HAS LITTLE NEW TO OFFER IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE The Japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said. The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last September. A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters "Japan has done what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait for those steps to take effect." The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S. Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17. Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non-regulated prices. "I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has," said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods. Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely. Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves. "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time, there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States," said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co. "The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year," he said. Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here. "The American approach is full of contradictions," Jardine Fleming's Edwards said. "If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market," Edwards said. But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S. Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact. Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd, said "The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export-dependent economy." REUTER

crude	AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said. December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday. "Fundamentals are awful," said Philip Lambert, analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln bpd, little changed from September levels. Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 18.5 mln bpd. The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian, in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war. The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile. Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S. Attack, analysts said. They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said. Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities, analysts said. But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible. Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew, said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response. "The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response. Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory," Pyne said. Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was "a responsible retaliation," with the U.S. Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict. Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however. He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation. The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said. The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger. Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower, analysts and traders said.

money-supply	FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY The Federal Open Market Committee at its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed. The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March. The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds rate "reference" range for policy, as in other recent meetings. At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No conclusions were contained in the minutes. In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC said that "somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets." The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions. He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value. Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later. Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC minutes showed, "the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions." In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data. One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken. The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer, preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead. However, "most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge." The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit. Reuter

money-fx	EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS European Community (EC) finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System (EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said. "There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System, with all that implies," Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort. The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January. The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system. But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS. He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries. They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins. But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors. He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates. The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and monetary integration. "We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system," Eyskens said. Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead. EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties. Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to "dedramatise" realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers. However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves. He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves. He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory. The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul. REUTER

trade	U.S. COMMERCE TRADE REPORT OMITS FREIGHT COSTS The Commerce Department said on that insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1 billion dlrs reported on Tuesday. The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after the initial trade report to issue a second report on a "customs value" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports. Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis. A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been revised downward. The Commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously. "My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's legislation that requires us to delay it two days," said Robert Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs. "But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure." The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs. The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in 1979. Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison with other countries that reported their trade balances on the same basis. The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration. Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures. "We're considering it," he said, "It's one of those dinosaur laws and I think it's time has come." The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration. Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures. "We're considering it," he said, "It's one of those dinosaur laws and I think its time has come." Reuter
trade	BALDRIGE SAYS U.S. WANTS JAPAN TRADE PROPOSALS U.S. Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige said he hopes Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will make specific proposals to ease U.S.-Japan trade friction at a meeting with President Reagan this week. He also told reporters he hopes the U.S. Will soon be able to lift sanctions imposed against Japan for alleged violations of an accord on semiconductors. "We have been very specific about our trade problems," he told a news conference during a stopover in Hong Kong. "I hope (Nakasone) brings some specific answers to the trade problems." "We want to lift the sanctions as soon as possible," Baldrige said. He said that once the U.S. Determines that Japan is selling semiconductors at cost it will be able to lift the 300 mln U.S. Dlrs of duties it imposed on Japanese electronics goods on April 17. "We have not seen that yet," he said, adding that it would take about one month to determine whether the alleged violations of a bilateral semiconductor pact had been discontinued. Baldrige did not say what specific solutions he wanted for U.S.-Japan trade problems. But the New York Times today quoted administration sources as saying that the U.S. May be able to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June. Japan would have to show that it had stopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access in Japan top U.S. Chip producers. Baldrige also said that despite the current trade rift, the U.S. And Japan have long had friendly ties that neither side wants to change. "We have a very special relationship with Japan. Japan is a friend and our ally," Baldrige said. "Neither one of us wants that to change." He also repeated statements that he did not foresee a trade war with Japan but that the U.S. Had no choice but to impose the trade sanctions. REUTER
crude	WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said. Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half. Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost protected economy. "Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support," Conable said in his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes. "We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed," Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold. But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation. He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector. Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87. REUTER

trade	U.S. SENATORS SAY SANCTIONS LIKELY ON MICROCHIPS The United States will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators said today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige. Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they said they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties. President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of which Baldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday. "I am confident we will see action taken," Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told reporters. "I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than sanctions," Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said. The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries. They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said. Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen. Pete Wilson told reporters, "The clear import of what he said is that there will be." "Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctions must be applied," for past violations of the agreement, the California Republican said. The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems. Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the United States or other countries. But McClure said senators told him, "There is no doubt dumping is going on," based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products. The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market. In return, the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips. Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to save the pact. Japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr trade deficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United States last year and had large surpluses with other countries. The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact since September. The resolution will be introduced in the House next week by Rep. Bob Matsui, a California Democrat. Reuter

Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at the accords, said "I firmly desire a faithfull and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit." On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords. The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged dollar slide. The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Washington last month. But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate rise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to." "What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow them," he added.

crude	MEES SAYS SECOND WEEK MARCH OPEC OUTPUT 14 MLN BPD OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated. A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd. MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of its total production into floating storage. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output, including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd. The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower than that. It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a further 25,000 bpd of "purchase crude." It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only 2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift at official prices. MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member countries calling for the formation of a committee to study what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among various members. The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was having difficulty selling crude at official prices. The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and "other forms of hydrocarbons" which are marketed in package deals with crude oil.

crude	LUKMAN SEES STABLE OIL PRICE FOR NEXT COUPLE YEARS The current crude oil price of between 18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said. Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government officials said. They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third World debt and industrialised nations. Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said. Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he said. This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high prices, he added. Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled. REUTER

crude	OFFSHORE OIL INDUSTRY WAITING FOR TURNAROUND The depressed offshore oil industry is still waiting for a turnaround despite increasing optimisim that world oil prices have stabilized around 18 dlrs a barrel. "The perception of a turnaround comes from the change in prices," Charles Siess Jr, vice chairman of Marathon Manufacturing Co, a subsidiary of USX Corp <X>, and chairman of the National Ocean Industries Association, said in a press briefing at the Offshore Technology Conference. "From the level of industry activity, there is no turnaround," he added. John Huff, president of Oceaneering International Inc <OCER>, was slightly more optimistic. "We are through the low part of the cycle -- there's an increase in interest for projects," he said, adding, "whether it comes to orders, who knows?" The oil industry is recovering from last year's dramatic fall in oil prices, from 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to under 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Particularly hard hit were the service companies that provide the oil rigs with keys products, such as pipe and tools. Earlier in the week, Secretary the Interior Donald Hodel announced -- at the Conference -- the government's new five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program, proposing 38 sales, including tracts in the Gulf Coast, offshore California and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. For the most part, the industry was disappointed with the plan, with most arguing that additional areas should have been included. At the same time, most were supportive of Hodel. Environmental concerns, particularly in California, had lobbied strenuously against offshore oil development. "The (Outer Continental Shelf) leasing program fails to take into account the environmental performance of the oil industry," said Bill Bradford, executive vice president of Dresser Industries <DI> and president of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association. Huff quoted National Academy of Science figures showing offshore rigs contributed only two pct of petroleum pollution in the oceans, while tankers were responsible for 47 pct and municiple dumping 31 pct. "The OCS is the keystone of the domestic reserve development program," said Siess, adding that with oil imports rising to 50 pct of U.S. oil consumption, the issue was one of national security. Looking ahead, Constantine S. Nicandros, president of Dupont's <DD> Conoco Inc subsidiary, said, "We are more likely to see a five pct increase in spending this year than the widely-forecast five pct decrease." Other optimistic signs include the recent sale in New Orleans of offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico which raised 290 mln dlrs against an expected 90 mln. However, Ronald Tappmeyer, vice chairman of Reading and Bates Drilling Co <RB>, said the oversupply of rigs would continue for the near-term, but added demand for technologically advanced rigs would increase in the 1990s. Much of that demand is seen coming from the move into icreasingly deeper waters, with the projects becoming ever more expensive and needing five to ten years to develop. Over 50 pct of the sales in New Orleans were for deep water tracts. Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell <RD>, and president of the Marine Technology Society, said the technology existed to drill exploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water. Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the Green Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of companies, including Shell, Conoco, USX Corp's Marathon Oil Co, Standard Oil Co <SRD> and Placid Oil Co, are working, many of them testing new deep-water technologies involving floating platforms.

At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said. He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable. Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental. "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said. The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said. It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said. Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable. He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement. Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks. The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago. REUTER

But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Texaco Inc <TX> and Chevron Corp <CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each.

trade	ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said. They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products. But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be their gain. The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost. Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes. "We wouldn't be able to do business," said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd <MC.T>. "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.," said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker <James Capel and Co>. In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried. "We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us," said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named. Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S. The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest. "We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation," said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters <Taiwan Safe Group>. A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan. Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S. In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports. "That is a very short-term view," said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry. "If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade," he said. The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports. The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday. "This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter," Button said. He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that country. Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy. The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year. They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an effort to end the dispute.

trade	KEY U.S. HOUSE PANEL FINISHES MAJOR TRADE BILL The House Ways and Means Committee completed action on legislation to toughen U.S. trade laws, chairman Dan Rostenkowski said. The committee's consideration of one of the most controversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States, was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its sponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was not certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal would take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10 pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such as Japan. The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate international trade agreements but it allows him to wave retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S. economy. The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions to grant domestic industries import relief. It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These powers are currently held by President Reagan. The administration has strongly objected to this transfer of authority from Reagan to Yeutter. The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate multilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped into other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April. Reuter

sugar	FRENCH PRODUCERS WITHDRAW SUGAR FROM INTERVENTION French producers have withdrawn all offers to sell more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar into European Community intervention stocks, EC Commission sources said. They also said West German producers had now withdrawn the last 3,000 of the 79,250 tonnes they sold into EC stores on April 1. The sales were made to protest against the level of export restitutions being granted for sugar at weekly EC tenders. Last Friday, commission sources said the West German producers had withdrawn all but 3,000 tonnes of their sales. The protest by European producers involved sales of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention, of which 785,000 tonnes were accepted by the commission. Under EC regulations, operators had five weeks before receiving payment to withdraw the sugar. Their decision to withdraw the sugar follows what commission sources have said is a slight shift in the authority's stance in recent weeks. The commission last week increased the maximum restitutions to within about 0.5 Ecus per kilo of the prices which traders claim are needed to match intervention prices. Reuter

trade	TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS Taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade talks with Washington which officials described as a move to help balance trade with the United States. Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington. "The move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United States," he said. He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and 50 pct. The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700 foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's largest trading partner. Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade deficit with Taipei. Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show. Today's announcement came before a departure later today of a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of trade talks with U.S. Officials. The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last night he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he would face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada. Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S. Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products, purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment, import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property. "I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from our talks with the U.S.," he said without elaborating. REUTER

He told the National People's Congress, China's parliament, that the country's foreign exchange is limited and must be used where it is most needed. "We should expand production of import substitutes and increase their proportion," he said. On exports, China should increase its proportion of manufactured goods, especially textiles, light industrial goods, electronics and machinery, he said. Zhao said China should lower the cost of exports and control the export of goods that incur too much loss. In 1986 China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs, down from a record 14 billion in 1985. Zhao said China should work to provide a more favourable investment environment for foreign businessmen. It should use foreign funds for production and construction, with stress on firms making goods for export or import substitutes. China should also earn more foreign exchange from tourists and contracted labour abroad, he added. REUTER
trade	JAPAN SAYS U.S.-JAPAN MICROCHIP PACT WORKING Japanese officials sought to convince the U.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove their case. "We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact," Osamu Watanabe, Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's (MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters. "The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place," he said. U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States. The agreement, signed last September, aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S. Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market. The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said. Yukio Honda, director of MITI's Industrial Electronics Division, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries. MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non-regulated grey market, Honda said. "The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, but in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices," Honda said. MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States, he added. The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said. Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls, regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results, Watanabe said. "I am optimistic," he added. REUTER

trade	JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY, MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17, industry analysts said. The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks, the analysts said. "Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry," analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said. But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far, and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run. Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs. "We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS," said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers. "Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching," Kurlack added. Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor accord with the U.S. The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the U.S. market. But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S. was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S. As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured. "The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington, but at the same time they're demonstating their muscle," analyst Peck said. The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit U.S. chip makers. "I think this could be a very important factor for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers," industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said. But analyst Peck said, "it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production." He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment.

crude	NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CLOSE REFINERY - ESSO SAF ESSO SAF <ESSF.PA>, the French subsidiary of Exxon Corp <XON>, said it had no immediate plans to shut down one of its two refineries. Exxon's new president Lee R. Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French refinery. An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that depended on the evolution of the market and refineries' ability to make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses. The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the spokesman added. Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant. Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close one of its French refineries. Reuter

No further details on the loan were immediately available. Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast. The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery. The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said. Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product, he added. REUTER

money-fx	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. "The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common," said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. "Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict. REUTER

He is the first high-level U.S. official to visit Japan since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose tariffs worth up to 30 mln dls on Japanese electronic goods on April 17 in retaliation for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a pact on microchip trade signed last September.

money-fx	TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS PACT Treasury Secretary James Baker said he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations to foster exchange rate stability around current levels. "I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals," Baker told The Cable News Network in an interview. "We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it," he said. Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to "co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around those levels." He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently tended "to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say." Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as saying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement that triggered this week's renewed decline of the dollar. "I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well," Baker said. The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was very important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade imbalances. He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker has also "been very outspoken" in suggesting main trading partners grow as fast as they can. Reuter

sugar	CUBAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN AT 7.5 MLN TONNES Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87) is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikow in its monthly sugar market review. Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year's domestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for export of which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will be taken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries and the remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations. Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75 mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export needs of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to be acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date may not be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said. Reuter

crude	NYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF-HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE The New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide. On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman. "This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman. Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained. The expanded program "will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc. The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts. Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction. Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials. When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading." The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman. Reuter
gold	PLACER PACIFIC SAYS BIG BELL GOLD STUDY EXPANDING <Placer Pacific Ltd> said it will undertake a full feasibility study of Western Australia's Big Bell gold prospect. Results of an economic evaluation of the find, in which Placer has an option with <Australian Consolidated Minerals Ltd> (ACM) to earn a 50 pct interest, were encouraging enough to warrant a full study, Placer said in a statement. Big Bell, in the Murchison goldfield 540 km north east of Perth, was founded in 1904. Between 1937 and 1955 it yielded 22.8 tonnes of gold and 7.8 tonnes of silver while milling about 30,000 tonnes of ore a month. Placer has said the prospect has an estimated 14 mln tonnes of ore with a three-gram-per-tonne concentration accessible by open-pit mining and a further 4.5 mln tonnes with a 4.4-gram-a-tonne concentration between 300 and 600 meters underground. It said it was obliged to produce the feasibility study no later than December 31 this year by which time it would have spent three mln dlrs on Big Bell. If the results are positive and a commitment to develop made then construction would take about 12 months, Placer said. REUTER

trade	U.S. MAY TELL JAPAN SANCTIONS CAN END - NY TIMES President Reagan is expected to tell Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone this week that the U.S. May be able to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June, the New York Times said. The newspaper, quoting administration officials, said that under such a scenario the President would announce just before the June 8-10 economic summit meeting in Venice that he hoped to lift the restrictions on electronics imports by the end of the month. Japan, for its part, would have to show that it had stopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access in Japan for U.S. Chip producers. The U.S. Administration imposed 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese color television sets, motorised tools and personal computers on April 17. Japanese officials have said Nakasone's main demand when he arrives for talks with Reagan on Wednesday would be the immediate lifting of the tariffs. But with Congress planning further trade reprisals against Japanese trade policies, the end-of-June timeframe is seen as the best Reagan can offer, the Times said. It said some verbal formulation was expected to be found in a communique that would allow Nakasone to claim at least a modest victory. REUTER

money-fx	IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street, Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a serious way, Japan investment managers say. The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar securities, have already sold U.S. Equities. But "if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw significant funds from U.S. Shares," said Akira Kawakami, deputy manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's international investment department. An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese investment in U.S. Bonds. "Japan-U.S. Interest rate differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing in the absence of dollar stability," said Kawakami. U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S. Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise. But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning. "Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to lighten their U.S. Stock inventories," Hiromitsu Sunada, manager of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment department said. Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914. "Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult, considering the dangers," said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed income securities marketing group. Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for. The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said. "The basic background which has supported the stocks and bonds markets has not changed," said Norio Okutsu, assistant general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. "But new outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing." However, this was already evident three months ago, he said. REUTER

He said the allocations were in line with Indonesia's production ceiling under its current OPEC quota, so they might be increased if OPEC ratifies a production rise next week. Allocations of Indonesia's main traded crude, Minas, had been cut by 50 pct and Duri by 38 pct, he said. Last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct. Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling. Oil traders said Indonesian grades were already trading above their official selling prices (osp) on the spot market due to strong demand from Japan and the U.S. And tight supplies.

The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May, three months longer than planned. The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the time, as happens now, the paper said. The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of Hormuz. It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against Iraq. U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of those missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quoted officials as saying. From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launch aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships could fire long-range missiles, the paper said. REUTER

money-fx	PHILADELPHIA EXCHANGE TO EXTEND HOURS FOR ASIA The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets, exchange president Nicholas Giordano said. He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between 1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third quarter this year. The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve clients in the region and educate financial markets about the advantages of currency options, Giordano said. Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the exchange-trade currency option market against existing over-the-counter option trading during the local working day. Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and had grown in popularity, he said. The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs. Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily. Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities, set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries access to a currency option market of much greater depth and liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

trade	WHITE HOUSE DISCOUNTS THREAT OF TRADE WAR President Reagan has reaffirmed his opposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said trade sanctions imposed on Japan were unlikely to start a trade war. "We don't want to go down that road," Reagan was quoted as telling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting French official expressed concern about the rising tide of protectionist sentiment in the United States. Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the new sanctions against Japan and said administration officials "do not believe this will result in a trade war." "It is the first time that the United States has taken an action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to be alarmed about," the presidential spokesman added. "We do not want protectionism ... We do not want a trade war," he said. Fitzwater said the president was forced to act in the Japanese microchip case because Tokyo had failed to fulfill "an agreement to make some corrections." Noting that there are "enormous pressures in the Congress and the land" for the United States to take a tough stand, he said, "This was a case where we felt we simply had to act." Fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was "well considered by this administration and not taken lightly." While the White House official held open the possibility that Washington and Tokyo will settle their trade dispute, he indicated a settlement probably would not come in time to head off the sanctions. "We are always open to negotations ... Whether it (a settlement) could occur in time to prevent this (the sanctions) from going into effect is questionable at this point," the spokesman said. The sanctions take effect in mid-April. REUTER

CENTRAL BANK SEES SLOWER MONEY, CREDIT GROWTH Monetary and credit growth rates in New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said. The monetary and credit growth figures for the December quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short term money market, Russell said in a statement. The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs of the recent expansion became apparent in September and October last year, Russell said. Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of 17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in the year ended September. Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was 30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.

In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as of April 1 and should continue until the United States is satisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement. The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor exports is not what is required.

trade	BALDRIGE PRAISES NEW SOUTH KOREAN TRADE POLICIES U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige praised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies but warned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's market liberalisation efforts falter or fail. In a press conference after talks with South Korean leaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intention to regulate exports and boost imports "a very, very important step, the right direction for the Korean government to take." The government adopted the new policies last week in the hope of heading off a trade war with the U.S. Baldrige said the policies "showed an understanding of the fact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing by exports alone." "There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growth begins to take more of the load," he said. South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus with Washington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars and consumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billion dlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year. Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was "broad enough and comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken for liberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, if the government is willing to follow through." "We will be watching the implementation of this new policy direction very closely," he said. "Because of the protectionism growing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does not keep on the same path ... Of steadily increasing liberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turn backward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd see protectionist movement in the U.S." Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specific product categories. These included service industries, which he said were still too much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers and cars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing the tariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make them sell for up to three times their American prices. "We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there's going to be trouble somewhere down the road," he said. "We are just pointing this out." Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without a revaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging for months, Baldrige declined to comment. "We don't have any target for any particular currency, but we do feel that currencies around the world, if we are going to be successful as a world economy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the various economies involved," he said. Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal for cooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures in third countries. The American government would be pleased to encourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added. Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increase tariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige said Washington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable to its difficulties with South Korea. "I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair," he said. "It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything for nothing or just by asking for it. "But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and they usually end up with something good happening at the end that both countries live up to." REUTER

Coupon rates on 10-year certificates maturing March 1995 will fall to 9.80 pct from 13.65 pct and rates on 10-year issues maturing in March 1996 would fall to 10.05 pct from 14.30 pct. The Treasury also cut by 0.60 point six-monthly coupons payable this September on six issues maturing between September 1988 and September 1991. The issues carry terms of between five and seven years and will have coupon rates of between 4.85 and 5.65 pct in September compared with 5.45 and 6.25 pct this March. REUTER

coffee	INDIA REDUCES EXPORT DUTY ON COFFEE India cut the export duty on coffee to 330 rupees per 100 kg from 600 rupees, effective March 23, a Coffee Board official said. The reduction should help India reach its coffee export target of 90,000 tonnes in fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31, against provisionally estimated exports of 75,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and an actual 99,254 tonnes in 1985/86, he said. India is likely to press for international export quotas at a meeting of coffee producers in London this week because of depressed prices, he added. The International Coffee Organisation, which represents both consumers and producers, has so far failed to reach agreement on quotas. India feels it will be useful to have quotas now because the slide in prices is unlikely to be halted immediately, he said. Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged after a drought devastated Brazil's coffee crop. REUTER
trade	YEUTTER SAYS U.S.-JAPAN TRADE DIFFICULTIES REMAIN U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April. "We are having high level discussions on them (the issues) within the United States...The relationship on some of those is very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date," he said. "I am not sure we can wait until late April," he added. Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries. Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors, Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the barring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka. The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country. "I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction. The question is how far and how fast," Yeutter said. REUTER

Talks broke down Thursday when the union walked out after employers tabled their final offer to end the strikes which started January 19 in protest at planned redundancies of 800 from the sector's 4,000 workforce, starting with 350 this year. The employers' invitation to restart the talks comes on the day a deadline set by Minister of Social Affairs Louw de Graaf for a resolution of the dispute expires.

crude	PARIBAS SEEKING TO ADJUST ECUADOR OIL FACILITY Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220 mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports, wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said. But the French bank's plan, which would effectively postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52 members of the loan syndicate. The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair. President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt. Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue. Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job for international financial organizations and not for commercial banks, bankers said. The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in August 1982. Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions for Latin borrowers will be set back. "There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a restructuring would look bad," one banker commented. Reuter
interest	INDIAN RATE CUTS TO SPARK INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE The Indian Finance Ministry's announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said. The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct by one percentage point. New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on deposits of two years or more but less than five. Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct interest have been abolished. Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help improve world competitiveness of Indian goods. There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity shares or short-term bank deposits, they said. A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market. Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange, opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing of 1,012.50 rupees. A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now to buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the Finance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5 pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively. "But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks pay for deposits of similar maturity," a merchant banker said. REUTER

Meanwhile, European Community (EC) external trade chief Willy de Clercq said that if Japan's trade surplus, which hit almost 90 billion dlrs last year, continued so high, there would be stormy weather ahead. U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter told trade leaders from Japan, the EC and Canada that there was at least a 50-50 chance that a protectionist bill reaching the House of Representatives this week would pass the Senate in September. The U.S. economy badly needed better trade figures by then, or President Ronald Reagan would have a difficult time vetoing such a bill, he said, according to a series of briefings to reporters by official delegates at the weekend meeting.

coffee	ICO BOARD SEEN UNLIKELY TO SET NEW COFFEE TALKS Chances that the International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO delegates and trade sources said. ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said. ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement. "Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions, it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage," Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime, he said. The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates said. At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some administrative matters, according to a draft agenda. The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned. "I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September (the next scheduled council meeting)," Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said. Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting. If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989. When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise. Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares, under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports, but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using "objective criteria," which would have threatened Brazil's share. At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers, Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO "dissident" producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting. However, other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity. London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today, down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March. Reuter

trade	CHIRAC, REAGAN DISCUSS ARMS CONTROL, TRADE French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and trade issues. French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to present France's concern that the United States might ignore European security interests in any accord with Moscow on removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent. But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats said. France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in other weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets, conventional forces and chemical weapons. Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position saying: "Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles." Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS. In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of Bethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). "This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure," Reagan said at the signing ceremony. He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80 per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation. The foundation would also raise private funds and would donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less developed countries. Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House East Room, with Reagan describing France as "America's oldest ally in war and peace." "I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the same ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers which we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new diseases and drugs," Chirac replied. But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on over the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise in protectionism in the U.S. Congress. A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of lessening surplus stocks. Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume, during his two-day visit to Washington. The U.S. official described the idea as a "grain producers' OPEC" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- and said it went against the Reagan administration's desire to lessen government intervention in trade.

Bankworkers' leaders said that a national strike launched yesterday to press for a 100 pct immediate pay rise and monthly salary adjustments had the support of most of the 700,000 workforce. The strike today closed the stock exchanges of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. For the government the one positive development on the labour front was the gradual return to work of the nation's 40,000 seamen, who began a national strike on February 27. A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro told Reuters about half the seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companies and that the strike looked close to an end. Otherwise the labour scene looked bleak, with the bank strike posing the most serious problems for Brazil's crisis-laden economy. "If this goes on for more than a few days it will have a serious effect because normal financial operations will grind to a halt," said a western diplomat in Sao Paulo. Today Brazil's 50,000 university teachers in the 42 federal universities launched a national strike, with a broad political demand as well as a pay claim. David Fleischer, head of the political science department in Brasilia university, told Reuters the National Association of Higher Education Teachers wanted a full congressional inquiry into what had happened to government education funds. He said the universities were strapped for cash and that the association suspected the junior partner in the coalition government, the Liberal Front Party, PFL, of using education funds for projects which had helped their candidates in elections. The PFL holds the Education Ministry. Hardly any sectors of the economy are proving immune to the current labour unrest, caused by the return of high inflation, officially pegged at 33 pct for January-February. Other possible strikes looming include stoppages by oil industry workers and social security workers. Reuter

trade	INDONESIA URGED TO DEREGULATE ITS ECONOMY World Bank President Barber Conable linked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers. "We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation of the economy," Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta. Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency. The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted. But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes. "The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them," he stated. Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half. Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto. He voiced support for measures already taken, including September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports. "The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today's world," he said. The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year. The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics and cement, western bankers and diplomats said. The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies. Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find funds to cover its share of development projects, which otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed. Japan's Ex-Im bank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month. REUTER
crude	SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER PACT Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: "I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled." Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements. "We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified," he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price. "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement," he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC. "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability," he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states. "Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC," Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures." Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year. "We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions," Nazer said. He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit.

He reaffirmed the U.S. would press ahead with efforts to reduce its budget deficit, resist protectionism and boost U.S. competitiveness.

trade	CANADA LEADERS FAIL TO SET PACT ON FREE TRADE Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said he held "frank" discussions with the Canadian province premiers on the pace of free trade talks with the United States, but the longstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to be settled. Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings with the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions would be held in June and September to discuss the role of the provinces in approving any new trade deal. But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years ago. "It appears reasonable progress is being made (in the talks)," Mulroney said. Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, "Things are running pretty quickly now." The talks, launched by Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the U.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the world's largest trading partnership. But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any new trading arrangement, and some of the provincial leaders complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification formula. "It's my view that we should be thinking about these things right now, along with the questions of the substance of the agreement," commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who has been highly critical of the talks in the past. But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no need for a "hard and fast formula." Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to make concessions to the United States on financial services in order to make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture. Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, say the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years. A rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented to the premiers at the June meeting while the finished document is hoped to be presented to Congress in October. "It's a very tight time frame," Ontario's Peterson said last night. "But at this moment it is tough to say what will transpire." Reuter
trade	JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS Basic reform of Japan's protected farm sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus, securities analysts said. The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they said. "In economic terms, reform would be a plus," said Christopher Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co. The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S., The analysts said. Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew. Reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth, it added. "There's a lot of slack," a U.S. Government official in Tokyo said. "All that money could be spent on something else." Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37 billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted. Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give a boost to domestic spending, economists said. "Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand," wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor at Kyoto Gakuen University. Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector. Employers groups also want change. "If you really want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices," Bumpei Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations told a recent press conference. External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with Japan. But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said. Although the full-time farm population is falling and there are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders. The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon, the analysts said. Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security, they said. Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity, they said. Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew. REUTER

gold	FORMER GOLD FIRM EXECUTIVES ARRESTED IN JAPAN The public prosecutors and police here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered, police said. The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June, 1985. Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet. The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees at its peak in early 1985. Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985, according to lawyers. Of them, some 18,000 clients claimed they could get back neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen, local press reports said. Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today included Hiroshi Ishikawa, 47, former Toyota Shoji president, and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list. They were suspected of having collaborated with the late Nagano in swindling about 1.5 billion yen from about 450 people in Osaka and nearby Kobe during a six month period just before the firm's bankruptcy, they said. Today's arrest came after narly two years of joint investigation by the public prosecutors and police, who had questioned about 3,000 of the firm's former employees, police sources said.

interest	U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said. The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms. In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a "megabank," where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground. The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that "exit bonds" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview with Reuters. "All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered," said the official, who asked not to be named. In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations. In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth. "The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well," said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception. The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis. "We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively," the official said. Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a "megabank" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called "exit bonds" for banks like regional American or European institutions. Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. He emphasised that the "megabank" was not an administration plan but "something some people have suggested." Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described. But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States. "If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don't think they ever will." He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution. Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor. "The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand," the official said. Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes. These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor. Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt. But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. "It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before," the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. "Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money," he added. He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines'. Reuter
trade	TRADE WAR FEARS MAY PROMPT STOCK MARKETS' DOWNTURN The threatened trade war between the United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin. But they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices mark the start of a "bear" market. "It's the billion dollar question," said Richard O'Brien, economist at American Express International Bank in London. Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods, may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit. And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S. Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets. "A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets," said O'Brien. "Now, it is much less certain." Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien. Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith Barney Harris Upham said "We're still in a bull market," adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and "The bear usually strikes slowly." Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in London, said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices. Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market, according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London. He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now to the French franc and West German mark. In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets. REUTER

sugar	EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN MARKING NO CHANGE IN POLICY The maximum export rebate granted at yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC Commission sources said. The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for 118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous week, but the change is explained by world market conditions. Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week, the sources said. They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from operators protesting that rebates are too low. Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar. But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless the Commission reviews its export policy, they said. REUTER

In a news conference, Fendt attributed the weak performance in the March trade balance to labour strikes in the country. March exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53 billion dlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986. March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to 1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March 1986. Fendt said that coffee earnings rose to 220 mln dlrs in March from 110 mln dlrs in February while oil derivatives were down to 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February. He said that although the March results were considerably lower than the same month last year, the government's target of an eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. The January-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, well below a similar period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs. Asked to explain the reason for his optimism, Fendt said they were estimating that in each of the last six months of the year the trade surplus would amount one billion dlrs. Reuter
sugar	EC SUGAR TENDER SAID TO MARK NO CHANGE IN POLICY The maximum rebate granted at yesterday's European Community (EC) sugar tender marked no change in policy towards producers' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the EC, EC commission sources said. They said this was despite the fact that the commission accepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention yesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being set too low. The maximum rebate at yesterday's tender was 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week. London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest ever granted. The commission sources said today the increase was entirely explained by world market conditions. The amount by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said. Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said were too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, the remainder being rejected as of too low quality. The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and payment for it. They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet, adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or two to review commission policy before making up their minds. The sources said the commission felt entitled to offer rebates at slightly below the level theoretically justifiable in the light of its 1987/88 farm price package proposal to reduce guaranteed prices for sugar by two pct from the start of the new season in July.

Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance." Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market." Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement.

The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the interbank market today, the officials said. The central bank was concerned about growing market expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices, the officials said. But money traders said the market generally shrugged off the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far below prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month CDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid was 3.75 pct, they said. The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said. The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy. "We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip any further," a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing market expectation of higher rates will remain. "If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay above four pct for the time being," he said. REUTER
money-supply	TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT The Central Bank issued 5.65 billion dlrs worth of certificates of deposit (CDs), boosting CD issues so far this year to 147.58 billion, a bank spokesman told Reuters. The new CDs, with maturities of six months, one year and two years, carry interest rates ranging from 4.07 pct to 5.12 pct, he said. The issues are intended to help curb the growth of the M-1b money supply which has grown as a result of increasing foreign exchange reserves. The reserves hit a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs last month. REUTER
coffee	COLOMBIA BLASTS U.S. FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export quotas. "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviria told Reuters in an interview. The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London. Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible. In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries. He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less. According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue. That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986. Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30. Reuter
sugar	INDONESIAN SUGAR OUTPUT FORECAST TO RISE IN 1987 Indonesian sugar output is forecast by the government to reach 2.126 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 against projected consumption of 2.039 mln tonnes, Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi said. Production in 1986, when Indonesia was forced to import sugar, is officially estimated at 2.016 mln tonnes against 1.728 mln in 1985. The U.S. Embassy said in its annual Agriculture Report on Indonesia there were growing signs that actual output was lower than official figures. It estimated 1986 production at 1.8 mln tonnes and forecast little change for 1987. Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar towards the end of last year and in early 1987 to boost low stocks. Affandi told reporters stocks fel to as low as 159,000 tonnes at the beginning of 1987. Industry sources said this represented under one month's consumption. The minister said Indonesia should hold three months' supply, or 510,000 tonnes. A spokesman for the National Logistics Bureau, which distributes and stores sugar, said stocks this month were 489,437 tonnes. The harvesting season begins in April. REUTER

trade	SOUTH KOREA TO MAINTAIN TRADE SURPLUS 3-5 YEARS South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt. He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position. He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs. Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its foreign debt was substantially reduced, he said "yes, I think so." Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products valued at 1.8 billion dlrs. About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan. Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen. He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce his country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan. Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy U.S. goods than Japanese goods. He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation. Rha said "I hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions." But he added "the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons." Speaking of his own country, he said "We have made a lot of concessions already." He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents. Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs. Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation." South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of textiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as television sets, video cassette records and personal computers. Its puchases from the United States include electronic testing equipment and grains and cotton. The trade mission's purchases here included three Boeing passenger planes for 400 mln dlrs, four McDonnell Douglas planes for 300 mln dlrs; and machinery worth 725 mln dlrs. Reuter
gold	GEODOME <GOEDF> TO START MINE CONSTRUCTION Geodome Resources Ltd said following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's <RTN> Stearns Catalytic unit, it will proceed with construction and pre-production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County, Idaho, as quickly as possible. The company said the study found proven ore reserves of 3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton. It said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three years for a rapid payback of capital costs. The company said the feasibility study calls for gold production averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune life. Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, it said. It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the associated mill by Geodome. Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton. Also excluded are reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade material that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold. The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price. Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201 dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the first three years, in constant dollars. Reuter
trade	CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY Canada's trade picture has brightened considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year. The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally. "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto. Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year. "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is indicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd. Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month. "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in its monthly report. Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs. Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal 10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion dlrs. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85 U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country. Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency. "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export performance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland's Donegan. But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's trade upturn. Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is probably transitory."

sugar	CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS China will not increase sugar imports substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints and large stocks, despite falling production and rising domestic demand, traders and the official press said. "Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to be extremely serious," the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986 plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated. The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year. The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500 tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure. The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the area under sugar was dropping. "Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate," the newspaper said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane is a major problem." A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian, south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in area planted. He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar. The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667 hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only 70 from one mu of sugarbeet. The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to 4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980. Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills. The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the official press has said. Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985. The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier. A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986 when the central government resumed control of imports. "As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas," the diplomat said. The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly as coal had priority. "How quickly they can move the sugar is one factor determining import levels," he said. Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba, China's major supplier through barter trade, he said. "China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about 152/153 dlrs a tonne," he added. "China is not a desperate buyer now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into the open market." A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding imports was price. "While the foreign trade situation has improved this year, foreign exchange restraints persist," he said. The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five pct a year but "a communist government is in a much better position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the foreign exchange situation demands it."

trade	TOKYO BIDS TO STOP CHIP ROW BECOMING TRADE WAR Japan is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war, government officials said. "We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States," a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said. On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact. That agreement, reached last year after heated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors. Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April. While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success, they said. "The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad," one official told Reuters. "We would very much like to do something to respond to that." In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers, not to the government. Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute, trade analysts said. They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact, included enforced production cuts. The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action. "Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement," said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. He accused the U.S. of being "irrational." He said the U.S. action had made the bilateral chip pact "meaningless." Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations. Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17. Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry plans to step up purchases of U.S. chips and to propose a joint investigation into U.S. allegations of chip dumping. Reuter

The report, looking at the country's financial development prospects, said Italy's large public sector deficit and growing public debt were among the considerations that made a gradual liberalization preferable. The report also favoured retention of the lira's six pct oscillation band with the European Monetary System (EMS) during the liberalization process in order to lessen short-term domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from portfolio adjustments. The lira's fluctuation margin is currently significantly higher than that allowed for other EMS currencies.

sugar	U.S. SUGAR PRODUCT AMENDMENT UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE An amendment approved by the House Agriculture Committee yesterday requiring quotas on U.S. imports of products containing sugar is unlikely to remain in a comprehensive trade bill, Congressional sources said. The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., would require quotas on the import of any merchandise containing over 25 pct sugar or other farm products which are now subject to U.S. quotas. Supporters of the amendment said it is aimed at curbing shipments of food products containing sugar from Canada. However, the Ways and Means committee, which has overall jurisdiction on trade legislation, will try to kill the amendment as protectionist, a committee aide said. An Agriculture committee aide acknowledged the proposal probably will not survive scrutiny by other House committees. But he said the amendment was introduced in part to send a warning to U.S. companies considering moving food processing plants to Canada to avoid the restrictive U.S. sugar quota. In debate on the amendment yesterday, Rep. Stangeland and other supporters said the proposal would have no effect on the status of foreign trade zones. Sugar producer groups pushed for the amendment on sugar-containing products because they believe sugar is being shipped to the United States in food products as a way to circumvent the quota on raw sugar. The sugar quota is only one mln short tons this year. Reuter
money-fx	U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS RATE SHIFTS ORDERLY Treasury Secretary James Baker said that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and have improved the prospects for a reduction in external imbalances to more sustainable levels. In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals." Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally been orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of external imbalances to more sustainable levels." As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances "simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers. He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strong domestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closely with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill. "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he said. Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this fall. "We should pay particular attention to the lack of continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed temporary," he said. Reuter

"The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy," he told a press conference. His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days. At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus. Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable. He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity, he added. REUTER
crude	NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15 until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle told Reuters. "We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna," he said. "The accord reached there means stability in the oil market and we shall continue making our contribution." The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts. OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth quarter. Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained within its December accord on output and prices. Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995. The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd. Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks. Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep prices stable. Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December. Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986. But firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit. Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to the producing oil companies to set the levels of production. REUTER

crude	TURKEY CALLS FOR DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DISPUTE Turkey said today its disputes with Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea, should be solved through negotiations. A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute and an agreement on this issue would effect the security, economy and other rights of both countries. "As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be found by bilateral negotiations," the statement said. Greece has repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the International Court of Justice. The two countries approached armed confrontation last month after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil.

money-fx	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. "The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common," said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community. Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system -- the French franc, Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. "Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict. REUTER

"The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy," he told a press conference. His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days. At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus. Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable. He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity, he added. REUTER

They said two billion dlrs worth of foreign currency loans would be available to firms willing to import industrial facilities, and 500 mln dlrs for those importing raw and intermediary materials and parts. Exporters, who previously received 645 won (0.769 dlrs) for each dollar's worth of overseas orders, will now get only 575 won (0.686 dlrs), they said. The officials said the government also stopped new bank loans given to aid the installation of export-oriented facilities by the nation's 30 largest business groups. A finance ministry official told Reuters the measures were part of the South Korean government's package to curb the increase in the nation's trade surpluses with major trading partners. South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.2 billion dlrs with the United States in 1986, against 4.1 billion in 1985. It had a surplus of 1.09 billion dlrs last year with the EC, against 188.8 mln dlrs in 1985. REUTER

coffee	COFFEE PRICES BAD NEWS FOR LATIN AMERICA -MINISTER A senior Nicaraguan official said a recent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically disastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries. Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO) executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to discuss the fall in coffee prices. London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to 1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February. Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on Latin America, both economically and politically. He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September. Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil. Central American economic ministers have estimated the region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in 1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement, Martinez said. He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because consumer members lack the political will to fully support commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to producers. REUTER
trade	JAPAN CONCERNED AT EC TRADE THREATS - MINISTER Japan is disappointed at the recent threats of trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just as the trade situation between the two is improving, Japanese Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said. "I am deeply concerned that the EC has moved to take a harsher line toward Japan despite this tangible improvement," he said in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a new centre designed to improve understanding between the two sides. Last week, foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed to impose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electrical goods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports. Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of EC manufactured goods in the year ended March 31. "I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through expansion." "While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit between Japan and the EC, I believe it should be rectified not by reducing trade through import restrictions or export restraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade," Tamura said.

The strict controls will require proof that large remittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactions rather than currency speculation. Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they were a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster appreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar, which would slow exports to the United States. Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports, shipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government approval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source.

crude	SAUDI ARABIA'S KING FAHD WANTS STABLE OIL PRICES King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group. His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month. King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December. The King replied: "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability." Non-OPEC countries "must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone," he said. Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark. In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure, due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987. A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the group's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output. The King also urged the world community to help the Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be resolved on the battlefield, he said. REUTER
crude	U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL The United States' dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s, according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates. Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977. "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990. "However, the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction," Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices. "An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy.

interest	BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to. The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage. "They're really making the discount houses suffer," said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. "Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates." This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50. "If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget," said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow. However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington. The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. "But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England," he added. The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day. REUTER

ship	NEITHER SIDE OPTIMISTIC ON ROTTERDAM PORT ISSUES Employers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told Reuters. Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions. "There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking," a union spokesman said. Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months. "The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all." "If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector, then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month," Schoufour said. The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with 350 this year. Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw the sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy. Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out their cases, but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from him before Wednesday at the earliest. Reuter

trade	U.S. MAY END ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN The United States may lift an additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later this month, Reagan Administration officials said. President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods. The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and portable computers. Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at below production costs. Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers. The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors. They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month. The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods. U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance with the agreement earlier this week. The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement. reuter

interest	TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues, government and private economists said. A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy, they said. Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said. But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said. Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase. A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S. And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. "They need to support the stock and security markets," he said. But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week. Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago. With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence, one government economist said. "There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't be that big," said another. Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own, although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year's economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said. Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending, one government economist said. In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation, one central bank official said. "That will at least take a couple of days, if not weeks," he said. REUTER

The newspaper characterized the harvest, which began in late November, 1986, as "a tense and pressured campaign." In a recent interview with the French communist party newspaper l'humanite, Cuban president Fidel Castro said that crude sugar production during the harvest would be "less than 7.5 mln tonnes. The harvest was plagued by a four year shortfall of rain which reduced the sugar content of the cane and by unseasonable rain storms during the first two months of this year which made cane cutting by mechanical combines virtually impossible. Many foreign sugar experts voiced doubts during the present harvest that raw sugar production would exceed last year's 7.2 mln tonne mark.

coffee	BRAZIL HAS NO SET COFFEE EXPORT TARGETS - IBC Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster said. He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country's export target to ICO-member countries. The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added. It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said. Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy, but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions. "We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic," Dauster added. He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement. "Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch," Dauster said. Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil's export quotas. "It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover," he said. The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas, he said. Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries. Close links would continue with these producers, particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present. He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts, although "no hypothesis has been abandoned." Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened. He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as some exporters had suggested. He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags. He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate until late April. Reuter

coffee	EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said. Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting. The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement, van Horick said. If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement, van Horick said. Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil. Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction. "Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal leaves it very little to object to," van Horick said. "The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality," he said. "Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone." Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said. Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota. "If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula, " van Horick said. At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude. "Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might just get an agreement," van Horick added. Reuter

crude	COLOMBIAN GROUP SUSPENDS BOMBINGS OF PIPELINES A Colombian group announced the suspension of its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government's levy of a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln dlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY>. There was no indication the government would meet the conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army (ELN). According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986. The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage. In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults. Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion. If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up to 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the penalty. Reuter
sugar	COLD, WET WEATHER SLOWS BEET GROWTH IN W. EUROPE Cold and wet weather in northern, western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said. Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields. But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth. Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development, Licht said. In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth. In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible. In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was favourable for beet growth, Licht said. In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage. In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union, it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets. In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development. Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where beets are maturing very early this year. Reuter

trade	U.S.-CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact, according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy research groups. The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross border trade would benefit both countries. But Cato chairman William Niskanen added "the two nations' generally harmonious trade relations are probably not sustainable without a new agreement." The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers remaining between their two countries. The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained. Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and this could hit some Canadian trade practices. He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts. Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S. exports to Canada. A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said. It would also increase the gross national products of both countries. Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

It said the state oil firm Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana (CEPE) notified foreign customers that it was declaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor. Ecuador"s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day (bpd). A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping station at El Salado on Ecuador's main pipeline was damaged.

crude	SAUDI OUTPUT SAID AT YEAR LOW TO HELP OPEC Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources said. They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's quota is 4.133 mln bpd. The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the world"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the sources said. King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs. "Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions," he said. The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday, down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage. The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices, the sources said. Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said. They expected low early March output to pick up towards the end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual obligations. REUTER

crude	AMOCO <AN> SEES 1ST QTR NET TOPPING 4TH QTR Amoco Corp first quarter profits are expected to exceed the 165 mln dlrs, or 65 cts per share, reported for 1986's fourth quarter, chairman Richard Morrow said. Speaking to reporters after a security analyst meeting, he said the gain was expected because of higher oil and gas prices, but declined to compare his expectations with the 331 mln dlrs, or 1.28 dlrs per share, the company earned in 1986's first quarter. Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco's first quarter refining and marketing results "will look pretty poor," because of low margins in January and February. The margins began to improve last month and look pretty good now, he added. Morrow said he expects oil product margins to remain good for the rest of the year, "but it remains to be seen if they will match 1986 levels." The Amoco chairman said he expects crude oil prices to remain in the 17 to 20 dlr barrel range for the rest of 1988 based on his belief that OPEC's agreement will hold. Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is 21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level would result in a 40 pct increase in oil company exploration spending. President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amoco reduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by a total of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a drop in oil and gas prices. Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that reserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end prices will remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said the drop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from 27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserve estimate by four pct. Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gas liquids production to decline about five pct this year from last year's 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals made last year when oil prices were falling. He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by the purchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels per day to the company's 1987 U.S. production. Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to be increasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-free gasoline, especially the higher octane grades. He said expected federal regulations on gasoline vapor pressure will further tighten the industry's gasoline production capacity. Reuter

crude	WORLD OIL DEMAND LIKELY TO INCREASE, SUBROTO SAYS Oil prices have stabilized in world markets and demand is likely to increase in the second half of the year, Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said. He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oil prices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixed price OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demand have been in equilibrium since March. If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second half of the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPEC producers have not been able to produce more oil at current prices, he said. But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting, whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels at its next meeting in June. He said in his speech that world oil production over the last two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or two mln barrels a day less than world oil demand. Oil production by industrialized countries, particularly the U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, but some of that slack will be taken up by increased production in Cameroon, India and other developing countries, he said. This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers and consumers in the industrialized world for the upper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlier speech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company. "If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resume its former role in world oil markets," he said. "But don't expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30 dlrs a barrel, at least not in the next three or four years," Subroto said. REUTER

Mousavi said the security of the Gulf region had nothing to do with the U.S. But Iran would resort to any action to defend the Gulf, "even those actions which are not thought probable by Westerners."

trade	IMF, WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS Amid new concerns about inflation, interest rate increases and trade confrontations, finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation. The meetings, under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further, upsetting bond and stock markets. Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance. Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works. The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil, which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans. Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states. The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries. "There's interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries, because their position is so extreme," a Reagan administration official said. He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue. The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems. The largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other problems. At the same time, the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct. The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies. These issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties. In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit, running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others to import more from developing countries. The discussions, from April six to 10, will be wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment, according to monetary sources. The talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from Japan, the sources said. The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing. There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports, further undermining the international trading system. At the same time, the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export mainstay of many developing countries. The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris, where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further. The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for further debate on economic policy coordination. As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America said it would reduce its federal budget deficit. Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations. Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects. The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization plan for the Bank, now being prepared. Reuter

trade	INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). "The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. "We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. Reuter

trade	U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO EASE EXPORT CONTROLS A key House panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes. The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security. Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad. The issue has been the subject of administration debate. The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered. Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices. Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April. Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests. "We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security," subcommittee chairman James Florio, a New Jersey Democrat said. The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices. The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction. At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product--digital audio recorders. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S. telecommunications products. Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S. companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and patent laws. Reuter
money-fx	POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the mark. President of the powerful and independent West German central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year, government officials say. (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA) But no official announcement has yet been made, raising eyebrows in West Germany's business community. The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank. There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982. Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up. Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980. In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century. But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate. "I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in West Germany," he told business journalists in Frankfurt recently. Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy. "Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external economy," she said. An economist at a German bank, who declined to be identified, said "If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply." One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to persuade the United States to stop "talking down" the dollar. For Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies. The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact. "This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they don't know - what the central banks can do," Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round, making a speculator's position worthless. Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career. A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker. He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf. Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced. "But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment," he said. Bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled. "They've burnt the fingers of many people," he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes, the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit. REUTER

crude	HODEL SAYS ODDS ON FINDING NEW ALASKA OIL 1-IN-5 U.S. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel said there was a one in five chance that new drilling in Alaska would find oil. "But if it's there, there's a very good chance that it would be a giant field," Hodel said on ABC's "Good Morning America." "So it is the best geological prospect that they (geologists) have talked to me about since I've been involved in this process," he said. Hodel announced yesterday that he would urge Congress to open up 1.5 mln acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil exploration despite fears of environmental damage threatening the Caribou herd in the region. He said today the exploration was needed in an effort to prevent future U.S. oil shortages and said oil drilling in the large Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska proved oil could be drilled without severely damaging the environment. He said the Caribou herd at Prudhoe Bay had tripled, contrary to concerns before the drilling operation that it would endanger the herd. Reuter
trade	BALDRIGE PREDICTS END OF U.S.-JAPAN TRADE DISPUTE The United States and Japan will soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors, U.S. Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television. Baldrige, referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement on semiconductors, said: "Their government wants to live up to it. Their industries haven't been doing it, and I think we'll have a good settlement to spare both sides." "I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven't lived up to this commitment," he said. He added: "I do not think there will be a trade war at all." On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17, because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement. The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as Japan started adhering to the agreement. But they said there was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the higher tariffs. Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong U.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down protectionist trade legislation now being drafted. He denied the action had been taken for that reason. REUTER
sugar	EUROPEAN BEET SOWINGS CATCH UP, USSR DELAYED Fine weather throughout Europe allowed farmers to make good progress with sugar beet sowings during the period April 16-21, but conditions in the Soviet Union remained unfavourable, West German analyst F.O. Licht said. With daytime temperatures in parts of Europe exceeding 20 degrees centigrade Licht said sowings have been boosted and may be completed in most countries by the end of the month. In France the beet growers' association said the entire crop could be sown within a week if the good weather persists. Sowings this year will still be behind 1986 but Licht noted that good results have often been produced from late-sown crops. In the Soviet Union, however, most beet-growing regions still had cool weather with night frosts. Only in the western Ukraine was it warm enough to permit sowings, Licht said. Sowings in the USSR will consequently be much later than last year when one mln hectares had already been drilled by mid-April. Reuter

Diplomats said this reflected Hungary's policy of keeping the sugar beet area stable under the current five-year plan (1985-89) and producing enough to cover only domestic demand despite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs. Drought cut the 1986 harvest to 3.58 mln tonnes from 4.07 mln in 1985.

coffee	COFFEE PRICES SET TO CONTINUE SLIDE - TRADERS Coffee prices look set to continue sliding in the near term, given the lack of progress towards a new International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quota accord, according to coffee traders and analysts. Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lows yesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, when the lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmed expectations that efforts to restore quotas would not be revived at this stage, they said. The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 cents a lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years. Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO's annual September council session, and in the interim the Brazilian frost season from June to August may prove the only bullish factor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futures bounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading range around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the market recovered from yesterday's "confidence blip," one trader commented. But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lower prices in the near future, one trade source said. The market had become increasingly vulnerable to yesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stg second position trading range for 22 successive sessions, he said. Technically the market is more likely to decline further as it absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the 1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a "three figure mentality," and speculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the psychological 1,000 stg level, he added. Some traders said today's upturn was in part due to Brazil's opening last night of May green coffee export registrations. This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as no surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and light trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence. However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test of support at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the only possible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach of Brazil's frost season, they said. Roasters are believed to be well covered, limiting activities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally not taking up producer offers, they added. Central American producers have sold the bulk of their current crops, but robusta producers in West Africa and Indonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment, and this could pressure prices further, traders said. However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to be bullish, advised caution. "Everybody's bearish now, just as they were bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg," he said. Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expressed doubts the price spiral would continue much below current levels. "One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers -- there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall." While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September 1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail prices. "Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like that at this stage," a General Foods spokesman said. Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in response to market weakness. At the beginning of March the price of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65 stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue to fall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added. Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in the near future. "The market seems to have established some equilibrium and doesn't look set to go much lower," a Nestle spokesman commented. Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, which fell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg per kilo for medium quality, traders added. Reuter

interest	U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state, economists said. An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending. "In the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure," noted Peter Spencer, U.K. Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data, which compared won stg August rise, U.K. Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities. Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data, before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone throughout. U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response, resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out. Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "With the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last thing the Bank of England would want to do," Spencer said. "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up," said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury. But "The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign," noted Paul Temperton, U.K. Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct. It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending. Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets. Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour, he said. In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity markets in the past few days, "There will almost certainly be a straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales," Temperton said. "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added. "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very serious panic and a flight to quality," Spencer said. A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending, adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending. Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing. Figures from the Banking Information Service showed personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66 billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments. REUTER
money-fx	DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish, and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here. "The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level," a senior dealer at one leading bank said. The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability. Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term, but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit. Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar. Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus. But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, the dealers said. If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on the dollar, they said. The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord, they added. "Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal," said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank. "There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year," said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi. But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention. Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks. The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said. But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars. However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said "The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March." Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said. REUTER
coffee	ICO COUNCIL ENDS IN FAILURE TO AGREE QUOTAS A special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council failed to agree on how to set coffee export quotas, ICO delegates said. Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often heated talks, delegates said. Export quotas -- the major device of the International Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in Brazil which cut its output by two thirds. Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting. Reuter
ship	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters. The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said. The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors. The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said. They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment. Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1. The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said. A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said. Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity. This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said. The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said. The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989. Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping. However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said. Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said. The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said. In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said. "World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world," said an official at a major Japanese shipping company. The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said. REUTER

trade	NAKASONE INTERVENES IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with the U.S. Over semiconductor trade, government officials said. At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices in semiconductors. Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S. That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors. Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action. Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output. In his letter, the contents of which were released today, Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets. In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.

crude	ABU DHABI MARKETING SAID NOT BREACHING OPEC PACT A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its crude oil without breaching OPEC accords. Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations. "The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production," he said. "The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market," he added. OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed. Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was ADNOC's most difficult ever but "a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment." He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported. In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products. Reuter

"We have now cleared three auctions and are left with only four, worth eight mln dlrs," the spokesman said without specifying the amount paid out. The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28. It has said the auctions were suspended because it planned to introduce a modified system after talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that the auction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange to approved private sector bidders, but would not be used to determine the kwacha's exchange rate. Last week, he said the auction had run into trouble because of a shortage of foreign exchange.

Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached. The additional output would be related to plans now under discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.

But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of 300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico might supply Ecuador's South Korean market.

coffee	U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED A voluntary compliance system for monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and trade sources. "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one analyst said. On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill. Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification, it will still be allowed entry. While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls, trade sources said. "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a U.S. Customs spokesman said. "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to destination)," he said. Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system. "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster. "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the producers' hands." Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market, in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount. Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely labelled. According to customs officials, several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations, forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans. "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko. Still, others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the U.S. in the near term. "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a threat," one trader said.

"The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has occurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should produce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this year and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100 billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," he said.

But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips. Speaking in a televised news conference linking several European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand. "There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought," said Shultz, speaking from Washington. "It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here. "It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy," he added. But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied: "These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the United States and Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market. "They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the agreement that it made become evident." He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a trend on only one month's data. The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value. Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand. Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem. He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would contain a major reduction.

trade	TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN Member states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves. Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March, up from 1.94 billion in February.

interest	UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES The six basis point rise of the past month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the dollar holds firm. "Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis points over the last month, largely over indications that inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms," Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities, said. Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the longer term. Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has become more important to the direction of debt futures than the beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy. The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down 1.5 pct, respectively. Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money supply announced this week was "surprising, much larger than expected," according to Kahan. "Unless quickly reversed," such a trend "will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative," Kahan said. Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which Kahan said have "slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board annual targets," the consequences could be a hint of economic weakness down the road, he said. Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently, analysts said. September T-bonds "are up almost six points since about May 18," Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93 in mid-June, Duggan said. While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far, and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted above the 93 level. "The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken out before this activity is anything other than a trading range market," Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst Brian Singer said. The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S. currency has made little headway of late, analysts said. "The critical variable remaining in the market is the value of the dollar," Kahan said. Additional influences next week will be possible developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact and size of the U.S. budget deficit, "although these will not be in the forefront of the market early next week," Kahan said. In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results with little excitement. However, a successful auction could prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market psychology. Reuter
money-fx	U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says. Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller, who joined the board last August. He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the volatility of exchange rates. Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation. His idea, which many conservative economists find appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan. It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation, key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly. Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base. "What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes," says Heller. In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies. A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa. The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early 1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world. But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the monetary system, is also being widely questioned. Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also. For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy. Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement. The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems. Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters. He appears convinced that officials from West Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing. The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates. As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis. "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary policy might be eased," he says. He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis. Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and traded on a world-wide basis, so "that an index has a relevance for the entire world," he says. In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes. "Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures, the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions," he says. However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system. He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities. Reuter

trade	U.S. CALLS FOR GREATER GATT CHECKS ON TRADE The United States has appealed for stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to enforce world trade rules. The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by the 93-nation body to promote fair trade. Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers 13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and services will take four years to negotiate. Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round. "The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the world trading system and the global economy," Smith said. "Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak, or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy." He also also urged that member states be accountable to each other for their trade policies. Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics. "We are interested in more periodic ministerial involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings," he said. GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the 12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute panel be set up to review the agreement. President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose tariffs against Japanese electronic goods. He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets to U.S. Exports. REUTER
crude	SHEARSON LEHMAN UPGRADES U.S. OIL STOCKS Analyst Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stocks today now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in holding to its prescribed production quotas. "It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota restraint, will boost the price of oil," Margoshes said. Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshes said he recommends Imperial Oil <IMO.A>, up 1/2 to 49-1/8, Standard Oil Co <SRD>, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon <XON> one to 83-1/8, and Chevron <CHV> 1-1/8 to 54-7/8. In addition, Margoshes said he recommended Atlantic Richfield <ARC> on a short-term basis, though he said he is still suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose 1-3/4 to 77. He said "the market could come down to test the 16 dlr a barrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil is positive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher oil prices." He noted that belief that the government is interested in raising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oil stocks today. Reuter
crude	ENIM OIL SIGNS CONTRACT WITH INDONESIA'S PERTAMINA <Enim Oil Co Ltd>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <Southern Cross Ltd> of Colorado, signed a production sharing contract with Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina to explore for oil in the Lematang block of Sumatra. It was the second production sharing contract signed by Pertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986. The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presence of Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oil production split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour. Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mln dlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first two years. The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oil producing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials said there is a good chance of getting a high return on investment. A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilled before, was neglected because it is deeper than surrounding blocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have now made seismic survey possible. The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contract Pertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February. Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina's favour with operational costs deducted. Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil's production share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interest in the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it finds oil. Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude for refining in Indonesia if its share exceeds 150,000 barrels a day. REUTER
money-supply	SPAIN RAISES BANKS' RESERVE REQUIREMENT The Bank of Spain said it raised the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened money supply and inflation targets. In a statement issued late last night, the central bank said the measure would take effect from March 13. "In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the monetary and inflation targets set by the government," the statement said. Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200 billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve requirement allowed by law is 20 pct. The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the rate unchanged. Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of 8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of 1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987. Banking sources said that although the January money supply figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared to have accelerated in February, raising government concern. Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that prices were under control. Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during 1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.

sugar	BEGHIN-SAY SEES SOLUTION TO EC SUGAR DISPUTE A settlement could soon be reached in the dispute between European sugar producers and the European Community over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes, president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading the protest, told journalists today. "Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution," he said, adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention. Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention. At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level. Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the long-term desire of producers to export to the world market, providing they were not losing money by doing so. Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date. The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers. REUTER

crude	TEXACO <TX> SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED Texaco Inc has re-established some key oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations. "Several companies say they are willing to start trading," Yates told Reuters in an interview. The company last week had stated that a number of domestic and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether. Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings. Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and other banks told Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and J.P. Morgan Co's <JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits to cover transactions, it said. The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984. The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case. "Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they could," Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting supplies. "It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an avalanche," he said. "Supplies were cut to the point where we could not run the system at anywhere near capacity." He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton said. It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company, canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas, Occidental Petroleum Co <OXY> demanded cash for crude, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC> asked for special safeguards. The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC <BP> last week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today said, "a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on supplying. They had cancelled last week." He declined to identify the company. <Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said. But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the Algerians, he added. Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter 11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines and oil supplies that are key to the company's business. "It will be business as usual for Texaco," said Martin Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer and Traub. "Creditors are a nervous bunch of people," he said. "But when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company." But other officials at Texaco were not immediately available to say whether discussions were being held with its banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished. Reuter

crude	EXXON OFFICIAL URGES PLANNING FOR NEXT OIL SURGE World governments should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp <XON> director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said. Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference. It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact, he said. McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered. Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said. He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year. More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East, he said. McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability. "It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of acreage for exploration," he said. Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum, he added. REUTER
interest	GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING The Association of German Cooperative Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time being. It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in the economy that could affect the long-term capital market. The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year's end and next year, it said. The association said generally low interest rates, prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth. The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short-term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market, which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy, it said. In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer-term capital market, the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy. On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987. The association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic money would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank could hold down money market rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said. Reuter

trade	GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS: U.S. A successful new GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient. "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round," he said. "The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems." The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said. "Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round." But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years. "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two," he said. "They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future," he said. Reuter
crude	SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's oil-dependent economy. The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices. The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea, has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day. Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance. Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy. The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans. Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel. With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves. The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community. Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans. But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said: "Banks are still reluctant to lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am not sure if it is firmly based." Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting. Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said: "While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government's highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry." It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here. Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986, compared with the same period in 1985. Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983. Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit. Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments. The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt. Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom. A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg.

trade	TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN Member states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves. Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March, up from 1.94 billion in February. In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one pct to 12.43 billion dlrs. In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine. Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application of French quality standards -- something EC states say often happens to their own exports entering Japan. Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London, because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract. However, British officials in London have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened. By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan. The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas. At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport, and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars. EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount. They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action. One of the problems Britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam, they point out. REUTER

money-fx	LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL The scale of foreign exchange intervention the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawson told reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange rate stability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if he favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels. May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention. In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg. Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have been playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitments toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris. "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added. Asked which techniques were available to preserve stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and interest rate changes could be used to tackle "the market pressures there are from time to time." "Interest rate stability is not an objective in that sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added. Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" by draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new issues of government securities and foreign currency sales, when the market allowed. This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention, he said. "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawson said. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale." REUTER
money-fx	U.S. TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE The departure of James Baker's closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will not change the course of Washington's domestic and international economic policies, U.S. officials said. Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation. U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in shepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through the U.S. Congress. But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure, to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers, signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury Secretary himself might leave soon. "It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it came up," one official said. Another commented, "Baker will miss him, but he's not going to stand in his way." There has been widespread speculation since last autumn that Darman sought a Wall Street job. Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out. Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed. "Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss," he said. U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be an undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term, at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as "indispensable" to Baker. Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system. But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives. Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council, spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before. Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a political strategist "and that's Baker's strength too," the official said. There were already indications that Baker, who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor. One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould, who holds the number three Treasury position of Under-Secretary. Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years. Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated. He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement, when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain curbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turning point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets. Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth. These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and the United State's massive trade deficit. That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman's departure. REUTER

sugar	NO TAIWAN SUGAR EXPORTS EXPECTED THIS YEAR Taiwan is not expected to export sugar this year because of falling production and growing domestic consumption, state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp said. A company spokesman told Reuters this will be the first time in more than 40 years Taiwan has not exported sugar. Last year, sugar exports totalled 149,755 tonnes. He said the actual production during the 1986/87 season (November/May) is about 480,000 tonnes, barely enough to meet local consumption. This compares with actual 1985/86 output of 570,000. He said the production fall was due to typhoon damage to more than 6,000 hectares of canefields last year. REUTER
coffee	COLOMBIA COFFEE REGISTRATIONS REMAIN OPEN Colombia's coffee export registrations remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters' association said. "The philosophy of the new policy is not to close registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed," he told Reuters. On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and May for an unlimited amount. Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6, or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the average in recent years. He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national coffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by Colombia. "The only change that could happen is, because of the volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations would be for June shipment, etc" Arango said. Reuter

money-fx	TAIWAN TO STUDY SUSPENDING FOREX CONTROLS Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financial officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls, a cabinet statement said. The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy and Central Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduce Taiwan's surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached a record 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month. Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministry and the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to ease the controls, but he did not give details. Yu said the government could maintain the framework of the foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. The controls would be used during emergency. Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its trade surplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion in 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's trade with the United States, according to official figures. But he said that while easing the controls would help reduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a short time. Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from growing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largest trading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports. Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, told Reuters: "The decision came a little bit late. But it was better than never." Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, said the government should rapidly relax its foreign exchange controls and open its market wider to help balance trade with its trading partners, especially the United States. "The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchange controls will not only help our trading partners, but also help our own economic problems," he said. He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boost Taiwan's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February. REUTER

Bank Negara said although Malaysia's net borrowing dropped in 1986, its external debt rose due to the 30 pct appreciation of the basket of currencies against which the ringgit is pegged. The basket comprises principally the U.S. Dollar, yen, mark, Swiss franc, French franc, sterling, guilder, Canadian and Singapore dollars, it added. Bank Negara said growth in external debt, which declined progressively from a peak of 58 pct in 1982 to 13.6 pct in 1985, rose by 20.2 pct in 1986.

Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt. "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," the president said during a visit to the quake zone. "A government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain." Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said. He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake, which killed at least 300 people. Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced. He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct.

The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1 billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs, compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and 1.113 billion dlrs of imports. Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery and raw materials, to increase industrial production. The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told reporters. Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the government were not included in the policy, they added. They said the country's total import bill (both commercial and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87. The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the economy. Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for its main export jute, "which will certainly affect our export earnings" in the coming year. Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln in 1986/87, according official figures. But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target. REUTER

KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. SEEN FALLING South Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrs trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S. companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said. He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation. Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr deficit with Japan. Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S. companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferred purchases from Japanese sources." Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are "mainly chemicals, machinery and parts." He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S. agricultural products. The current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of cotton" from the U.S. He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American market.

crude	U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL A White House-ordered report said that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security. The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations. President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry. Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that "although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports." The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct. Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s. The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation's economy. The study was outlined in a New York Times report today. Reuter

Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year. Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said. Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices, exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan. Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said. The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said. Reuter

trade	JAPAN IN LAST DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE CHIP PACT Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further. "We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe," Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters. "If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will create very serious problems." The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors. Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory action. In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export. Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year. He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market. "We have almost no grey market," he said. "Supply is diminishing." To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker, NEC Corp <NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of <Texas Instruments Inc>. Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers. The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker Micron Technology Inc <DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in Hong Kong. Yamamoto admitted that <Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices. "If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We will present our rebuttal," he said. The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said. He also called the case "strange," but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.

crude	ECUADOR TO PRODUCE ABOVE OPEC QUOTA - MINISTER Ecuador will produce crude oil in excess of its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this year, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news conference. Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to 320,000 bpd next January, the minister said. "We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to produce during the past few months," he said. Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean production from March to May this year. Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved. "They understood our position and we believe we remain within the spirit of the (quota) agreement," he said. Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported. While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four mln barrels of products, Santos said. Reuter

trade	JAPAN GIVEN LITTLE HOPE OF AVOIDING U.S. SANCTIONS A top U.S. Official said Japan has little chance of convincing the U.S. To drop threatened trade sanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for Washington today. Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan's moves to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports said, and replied: "...It is probably too early for the figures to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to permit the result you have described." Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues. "There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area, but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on security and political issues," he said. "The question is whether through cooperative actions between our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist legislation," he said.

money-supply	U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said. The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been "acting a bit strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days. However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact. During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions. On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole. For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at the smallest banks. Reuter
crude	ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

trade	U.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR Export Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said. Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57. A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years. Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services. The department's annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg. Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports. The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at." "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing," Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients. He noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list. REUTER

coffee	NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER New York coffee futures prices will probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts. Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00 dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the International Coffee Organization did not place new export quota discussions on its current agenda. Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February. "Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents, perhaps 85 cents," said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with Elders Futures. "But the additional downside may not be all that great from current levels." "At this price level the market is very vulnerable to bullish developments," O'Neill added. "Rather than us having a market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode -- probably to around 85 cents." "I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief drop to 85 cents," said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor, with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time. A trader at a major international trade house, who asked not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high export price and requires a high contribution quota from exporters the market could steady at the lower levels. Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new international agreement could come into force next fall. Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and demand. Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will need to do some buying soon. "Most producing nations have just completed or are about to complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly overburdened," said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report. Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell, and "this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows." Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before Brazil's frost season begins in June. Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by, though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is passed and demand usually slows this time of year. Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown for the usually busy winter roasting season. But Elders O'Neill said, "The roasters are not overstocked by any means." Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult, given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short term.

money-supply	GERMAN FEBRUARY CENTRAL BANK MONEY GROWTH STEADY West German central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct reported in January, provisional data from the Bundesbank showed. The figure was thus outside the three to six pct range set by the Bundesbank for 1987. In absolute terms, the measure rose to 223.2 billion marks in February from 221.8 billion in the prior month. The data showed that the stock grew at an annualized 8.6 pct over the six months to February, slower than the 9.4 pct rise in the same period to January. Of the two components comprising central bank money stock, cash in circulation rose to 111.7 billion marks in February from 110.9 billion in January, the Bundesbank data showed. This gave an annualized 8.3 pct rise over the six months to February, down from a 10.2 pct increase over the six months to January. Minimum reserve requirements on domestic liabilities grew to 111.5 billion marks in February from 110.9 billion in January. This yielded an annualized 8.8 pct rise over the six month to February, up slightly from an 8.6 pct increase over the same period to January. REUTER

crude	KUWAIT SEES OPEC OUTPUT OVER CEILING TO END-YEAR OPEC output for the second half of 1987, including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday, Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said. Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter target. Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, "OPEC third quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd" Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices. Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd, rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September. Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369 mln in the second half. Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. "We will not discuss it. There will not be any change," he said. Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed. "We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet," he said. Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting. Ali said "The problem of differentials is a real one. I would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes." Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said "If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do the work of another minister." Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades. OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes. Reuter

crude	CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct. On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs. "This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive," Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year's results, analysts said. "But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future," Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986. Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc <TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc <TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. "However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher," analyst Plexman said. "Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant," he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and <Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. "The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust," Texaco Canada said in its annual report. "While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely," Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work. "The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected," Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said. "For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more," Maciej said.

crude	OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS Some OPEC states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say. They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive. There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes, to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices. But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity. "All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials," said one analyst with a major oil company. "But at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be "leave well alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered." Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases, marketing incentives have helped their sales. Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a "package." Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers. OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months. Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials, analysts say. The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest. Extra heavy crudes were among those left out. Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices, with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products. Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year, when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices. Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent. In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived, due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has risen. Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel. But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna. "It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which holds the presidency, raised the issue," he said. REUTER

trade	REAGAN READY TO IMPOSE TRADE CURBS AGAINST JAPAN President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States, White House officials said. There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States, but officials said the move could come today or early next week. Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan include tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors. The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal computers, television receivers and laser-printers, with the aim of penalizing Japan's major electronic firms, including NEC Corp, Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu Ltd. They said Reaan could also delay invoking sanctions for a week or two, giving Japan a final opportunity to end the dumping practice, but added that negotiators had already held extensive talks with the Japanese to no avail.

"I'm convinced we're about to see an improvement on the import side. I'm more concerned about the export side," he told a House Appropriations subcommittee. Part of the blame goes on other countries which have not generated the economic growth to increase demand for U.S. goods and part to some U.S. companies which are not generating competitive exports, he said.

gold	BHP TO FLOAT GOLD UNIT WITH ONE-FOR-THREE ISSUE The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> (BHP) said it plans a renounceable one-for-three issue of rights to float a new company, <BHP Gold Mines Ltd> (BHPGM), which will hold most of BHP's gold interests. In a statement BHP said the 25-cent par rights would be priced at 50 cents for 430 mln of the BHPGM shares on offer. BHP will subscribe for the remaining 540 mln shares, or 56 pct of issued capital, on the same terms. BHPGM will pay 440 mln dlrs for BHP's gold interests, excluding its stake in Papua New Guinea's <Ok Tedi Mining Ltd> and those interests held by BHP's <Utah International Inc>. The BHP statement said the issue will be made to shareholders registered on March 27. It opens April 4 and closes April 29, and is underwritten by <J.B. Were and Son>. Rights will be traded on Australian stock exchanges from March 23 to April 22, and the new shares will be quoted from June 4. BHP said the new company will be one of Australia's larger gold producers, with annual output exceeding 170,000 ounces. It said there are plans to boost production to 300,000 ounces by the early 1990s. BHPGM's portfolio will include several Australian mines -- 30 pct of Telfer, 100 pct of Ora Banda and Browns Creek and 20 pct of the new Boddington development. The statement said BHPGM would also hold BHP's 45 pct stake in the Coronation Hill Property in the Northern Territory, and its 55 pct stake in a new venture near Gympie, Queensland. BHPGM chairman-designate John Gough said it was a quality gold stock. "The diversity and depth of BHP Gold's portfolio ...

DOE alleged Trigon caused overcharges of 624,208 dlrs by improperly classifying its oil as "newly discovered crude," a classification that allowed charging higher prices during a period of price controls. It said the proposed settlements would resolve disputes over possible violations by the five parties. DOE added that in agreeing to the settlements, the five did not admit any violations or non-compliance with its regulations.

But Fitzwater noted that Reagan did have a fundamental objection to tax rises and special tax breaks.

trade	JAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP-EXPORT CURBS The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness. A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters. Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said. But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak. U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement. Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement. The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure." MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said. But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money," a Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> spokesman said. REUTER

sugar	CUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED Cuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct shipments to its export markets, dealers here said. Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts. The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said. Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month. Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes. Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets, traders said. Reuter

crude	ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000, probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars. "I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000). Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," Hodel told the Senate Energy Committee. Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration. Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay. "The area could contain potentially recoverable oil resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production," Hodel said. He said production from the new section could begin about the time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000 without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area. Reuter

gold	NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities. Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year. And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character, though they are aimed at a less professional market. The market is still small. Taken together, the four American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs. But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future. Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG said: "The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long-term investment in gold with limited risk." Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27, following it up with a second issue less than a week later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA. The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York. The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the same price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank. The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases longer than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets. The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a jump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation. "Many people are worried about inflation again," said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs. "Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold." The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited. Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland. "People here understand gold, and they understand warrants," he said. Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage. But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks. The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market. Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for five ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct. Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's long, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off, which he claimed was lower than the other issues. But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science. And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct. Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm welcome from investors. Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand, even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece. "The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because the premiums are too high," he said. REUTER

As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet season. Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane. Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub-soil moisture. Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops, he said. Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of May, he said. The cane crush normally runs from June to December. REUTER

crude	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said. The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector. Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982. But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long. Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price. Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987. King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy. Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985. Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981. "Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects," a diplomat said. In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs. But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term. It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy. Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to "tough it out" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves. The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out. Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year. "It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy," he said. Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary. The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom. Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply. The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit. Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment. Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit. As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

interest	LITTLE SCOPE FOR U.S. RATE RISE - FANNIE MAE<FNM> There is little scope for a substantial increase in U.S. interest rates during 1987, said Federal National Mortgage Association chairman David Maxwell. Speaking to the New York Financial Writers' Association, Maxwell said he viewed this week's rise in U.S. banks' prime rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct as a temporary phenomenon. "I don't see a substantial rise in rates this year. If anything, the Federal Reserve is more likely to ease than to tighten (monetary policy) because so many sectors of the economy are showing weakness," Maxwell said. Fannie Mae buys mortgages from lenders and issues mortgage-backed securities. Maxwell said restructuring of Fannie Mae over the last two years had limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. A one pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18 cts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said. Maxwell also questioned the view that housing crowds out other sectors of the economy from obtaining needed capital. "There's no evidence that housing is crowding firms out of the long-term debt market," he said. Both home mortgage debt and long-term corporate debt grew at about equal annual rates of about 13 pct in 1986 -- a year when mortgage originations of 442 billion dlrs needed record housing capital, he said.

Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S. Legislators were failing to realise "the true nature of the two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment. A British parliamentary report said that up to March British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.

Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts under conditions of fair and open competition. "All we ask is for our companies to be given similar opportunities," he added. If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures, Younger said. REUTER

crude	SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER OPEC PACT Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: "I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled." Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements. "We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified," he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price. "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement," he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC. "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability," he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states. "Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC," Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures." Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year. "We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions," Nazer said. He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit. REUTER
crude	MARATHON RAISES CRUDE OIL POSTINGS 50 CTS/BBL, WTI NOW 19.00 DLRS.
crude	FTC FINDS 17 BILLION DLR COST IN OIL IMPORT FEE An oil import fee could cost consumers nearly 17 billion dlrs a year and undermine long-term U.S. energy security by leading to a quicker depletion of domestic reserves, a Federal Trade Commission study said. The study by the FTC's bureau of economics found that a five dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil imports would increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs a year. After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against the costs, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee would have a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year. Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10 dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cut the federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energy conservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil. But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs would reduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domestic oil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found. "Any attempt to increase our energy security by limiting imports will actually reduce our long-run energy security by speeding the depletion of domestic reserves," the study said. The five dlr a barrel tariff would also cut domestic petroleum refiners' profits by 7.5 to 10 billion dlrs a year, increase domestic crude oil producers' profits by about 13 billion dlrs a year and raise government revenues by 6.7 to 8.2 billion dlrs a year, the FTC said. Under the Reagan administration, the FTC has consistently opposed government regulation of the oil industry at the state and federal levels. "This study backs up my belief that government regulation and interference with competition hurt both the market and consumers," FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a statement. Reuter

crude	BP<BP> OFFER RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR OIL VALUES British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay 7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said. "I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher," said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own. "It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack," said Prescott, Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier. "Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those that are acquisition targets," Lazier said. One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock. Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years, with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp <AHC>. He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive. U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon Corp <XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp <CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco <TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal Corp <UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY> climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp <AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4. Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4. Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid. British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8. Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry. Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices. "They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view," Margoshes said. "They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded," Margoshes said. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel. Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year. They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope. Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves. "I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the U.S. market," Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said. Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one. After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is held in the U.S. "The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States. No other market can handle all that stock," said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua. In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs. Reuter

crude	AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia's petroleum taxation structure. The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government's position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference. As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum. APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said. It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation. Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure. "The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based," the APEA council said. The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's problems, the council said. The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices. REUTER

He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes. New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. "Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future." He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. "That's a very healthy development," he added."If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist." "Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit," Yeutter said. "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago." He added, "Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter." REUTER

coffee	COSTA RICA OPTIMISTIC ABOUT REFORMING ICO Costa Rica's economy minister said he sees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee Organisation system of export quotas. Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful because of the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing- nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britain and the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london. Escalante told a news conference here he "carried the weight of the negotiations" at the meeting by calling for larger export quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations. Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota system based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once it has satisfied internal demand. "There are countries such as our own whose sales possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current quotas," Escalante said. At the same time, there are countries favoured by the current system that have been assigned quotas far above their export potential, he said. The current ICO quota system is "unfair and autocratic," Escalante said. Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee prices over the last week to speculation rather than real matters of supply and demand. "Be careful," he warned, "there's not as much coffee in the world as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust." Reuter
trade	EC, U.S. PLAN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS The European Community is willing to offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year, an EC commission spokesman said. He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq. EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S. Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones, the spokesman said. Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S. Manufacturers. It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year. Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France, Britain, West Germany and Spain, the countries involved in the Airbus project.

trade	JAPAN SAYS IT TRYING TO EXPAND DOMESTIC DEMAND Japan has assured a meeting of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy. Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that, in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September, a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987/88 budget is approved. Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting, said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy, but did not elaborate. Hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits, payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries. Despite great potential, developing economies are still confronted by grave difficulties, particularly debt, he added. The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and the subsequent trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva. "It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment to implementing that plan as scheduled," Hata said. Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations in some areas at the expense of others. In order to rebuild the free trade system, it is important for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve this end. As part of its contribution, Japan plans in April to fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for industrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic market more open to developing countries, he said.

sugar	EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review. The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the intervention price, with detrimental consequences for producers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar. The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time limit on storage contracts, which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September, Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced. If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price, the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says. The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy, Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules. The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price, Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission's hand. In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price, West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the "green" mark. Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC's export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it says. The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says, suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of "unnecessary bureaucracy" surrounding the export tender system.

U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise. The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private group, also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques. It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption. It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports. Reuter

The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after U.S. naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a ship moored off Kuwait and flying the U.S. flag. Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the attack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied, "I believe what the United States has done is their responsibility as a superpower."

"Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the Paris Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic conditions," Baker told a Senate committee. Baker continued, "We said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels."

He cited news reports that Germany would increase a proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth. Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the Japanese budget was made final.

Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices, exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan. Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said. The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said. REUTER
trade	EUROPE ON SIDELINES IN U.S-JAPAN MICROCHIP ROW Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the United States and Japan. Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe, as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold. The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said. But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus. "The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the U.S.," said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy Research Centre in London. "Basically, their policies are pretty much the same." But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically, Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said. "In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here," he added. "In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich." Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's tendency to impose so-called "countervailing duties" - an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair. In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said. In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade. But the European Community has challenged the agreement as a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) practices that discriminates against its microchip producers. "It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of the United States in defence of the agreement," said Wolf. Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row. A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances. In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC. Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a trade war, they said. Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits, cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to try to improve the situation, the diplomats said. In Britain, where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered. But government officials said last night, "We are not talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time." They said the government would consider its options at a cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial markets, government officials said. REUTER
money-fx	ZAMBIA'S KWACHA FALLS AT WEEKLY AUCTION The Zambian kwacha fell at this week's foreign exchange auction to 18.75 kwacha to the dollar from last week's 16.95, the Bank of Zambia said. The rate was the lowest since the auctions resumed two weeks ago under a new two-tier exchange rate system worked out with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The Bank of Zambia said it received 370 bids, ranging from 13.00 to 20.75 kwacha, for the six mln dlrs on offer. One hundred and thirty-five bids were successful. A British High Commission spokesman said Britain would put eight mln stg into the auction at a rate of one mln a week as soon as Zambia reached a full agreement with the IMF. The money could be spent only on goods produced and supplied by British firms, excluding luxuries and defence equipment, the spokesman added. Reuter
trade	U.S. MAY TELL JAPAN SANCTIONS CAN END - NY TIMES President Reagan is expected to tell Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone this week that the U.S. May be able to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June, the New York Times said. The newspaper, quoting administration officials, said that under such a scenario the President would announce just before the June 8-10 economic summit meeting in Venice that he hoped to lift the restrictions on electronics imports by the end of the month. Japan, for its part, would have to show that it had stopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access in Japan for U.S. Chip producers. The U.S. Administration imposed 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese color television sets, motorised tools and personal computers on April 17. Japanese officials have said Nakasone's main demand when he arrives for talks with Reagan on Wednesday would be the immediate lifting of the tariffs. But with Congress planning further trade reprisals against Japanese trade policies, the end-of-June timeframe is seen as the best Reagan can offer, the Times said. It said some verbal formulation was expected to be found in a communique that would allow Nakasone to claim at least a modest victory. REUTER

crude	STUDY GROUP URGES INCREASED U.S. OIL RESERVES A study group said the United States should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry. U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise. The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private group, also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques. It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption. The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil. But the group did not strongly back either option, saying there were benefits and drawbacks to both. It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports. Reuter
trade	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said. "The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports," said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest. Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade. The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods. U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year. But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack. "In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing," said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC. Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986. The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion. And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago. Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation. Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987. The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of "big-ticket" manufactured goods, notably cars. Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985. "The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers," said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment. A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries. But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says. Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion. Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. "A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been at Japan's expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies. But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say. The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct. But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say. "We've not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes," said Bethlehem Steel's Wendt. And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect. Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration's free-trade stance. "It's hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then the question is, will it have teeth?" one economist said. Reuter

Earlier, she told a meeting of Soviet and British businessmen that she had agreed with Ryzhkov that they would work to achieve a total volume of 2.5 billion roubles in bilateral trade by 1990. This would entail an increase by each side of 350 to 400 mln stg over their present export levels.

The official, a member of the U.S. delegation to ICO talks earlier this year, said no new coffee agreement talks are expected because there is no indication the negotiating positions of major producers and consumers have changed. The U.S. still demands, as a condition of reimposition of coffee quotas, that "objective criteria" be set for establishing quotas, said the U.S. official, who asked not to be identified. Brazil, the major producer, insists on quotas based on a traditional formula. The U.S. remains open to a negotiating meeting but only if some new flexibility is apparent from major countries, the official said. The ICO executive board meets tomorrow in London. Reuter
sugar	AUSTRALIAN SUGAR AREAS SAID RECEIVING SOME RAIN Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman said. The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay regions, he said from Brisbane. Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state and in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very good after heavy falls this month, he said. The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which is harvested from around June to December. He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to restore normal moisture to the cane. But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said. "It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it might be in a month without some good falls," he said. REUTER

Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591 mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln dlrs in the first week of the period. Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of 447 mln dlrs. A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in the week ended Wednesday. Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for 65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90 pct of the borrowing. Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28. Float ranged from about 250 mln dlrs on Thursday to between one and 1.25 billion dlrs on Monday and Tuesday. The spokesman said Monday's float included 500 mln dlrs in holdover float at one Fed branch due to mechanical problems. About 500 mln dlrs of Tuesday's float reflected non-weather-related transportation float in one Eastern Reserve bank. As-of adjustments ranged from minus 500 mln dlrs on Monday, when cash letter errors at two eastern reserve banks were corrected, to plus 500 mln dlrs on Thursday, when a correction was made to unposted funds at a single bank. In the first half of the statement period ended Wednesday, banks held excess reserves on the first four days of the week but ran a deficit on Wednesday. In the second week, they ran a deficit on Thursday, Friday and Monday but held excess reserves on the final two days. Reuter

money-fx	SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods. SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan. Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year. In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency. Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers. Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today. With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire. Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's economic performance. The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears. This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments. Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said. Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF representative had told him the fund's executive board was "very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months." The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more. Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30. REUTER

He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied: "Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters." Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together. REUTER

coffee	COLOMBIA COFFEE EXPORTERS BELIEVE IN PRAGMATISM Private coffee exporters say Colombia's more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions. Gilberto Arango, president of the exporters' association, said in an interview that Colombia, the world's second largest producer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas. "Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation," he said. Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986, and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue. Arango said that government measures adopted here last week, including a lower export registration price, indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism. "This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world market conditions are also new," he said. The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends. Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount. But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee. "Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away." Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming exports, he said. "We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full well what Colombia's export potential is," he said. Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986. Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not exceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the National Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was "ridiculous." He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the number one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags. On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise. Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head of his nation's delegation in London, has blamed the intransigence of some big countries, without naming them. However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar Gaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy. "Washington will have to take into account that for many countries, and some of its allies for instance in Central America, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far-reaching political and economic consequences." Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts. Reuter

Previous ISO chief William Miller retired at end-February last year. Ricart told Reuters his first aim is put the "house in order" by having a new administrative sugar pact with improved allocations of voting rights and financial contributions. Once this is done, time can be dedicated to working towards a new International Sugar Agreement (ISA) with economic clauses, he said. Ricart, currently the Dominican Republic's ambassador to Austria, the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva, said he will visit the four major exporters - Australia, Brazil, Cuba and the European Community - to talk to governments and producers and find out about problems that are preventing these countries finding common ground for a new sugar pact.

ship	U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not place any restrictions on its actions. The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region. The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships. The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and Republican leadership as well as by the administration -- required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf. It did not, however, place any restrictions on the administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy. The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature. Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a first step toward a greater congressional involvement in formulating policy. But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the administration to address tough policy questions in the report. Reuter

The unadjusted rise was 1.31 billion stg, compared with an 813 mln stg increase in January. The Banking Information Service said the adjusted rise of 1.6 billion stg was well above the recent monthly average of about 1.0 billion stg. Of the increase, 297 mln stg was accounted for by personal lending, which the Banking Information Service said was taken up entirely by lending for home purchases. Lending for consumption fell around 17 mln stg while about 182 mln stg of credit card debt was repaid during the month. Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg, and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg. The Banking Information Service said February fell within the governmemnt tax season, so much of the lending was probably the result of industry's need to pay its tax bills. Deposits by the private sector rose an unadjusted 1.1 billion stg in February and by a seasonally-adjusted 1.75 billion stg. Deposits from the public sector rose 185 mln stg in February while deposits from overseas residents rose by 43 mln. REUTER

Sheikh Ali told Kuwait's daily al-Anba "All OPEC states, without exception, are producing within the quotas allocated to them. Some of them are producing less." Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab Emirates, which had been generally been producing over its quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of this year. Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but an earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected its quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell.

crude	LAWSON OIL TAX BREAKS TO HELP NEW FIELDS - REVENUE Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement. Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was not immediately available against other development expenditure, the statement said. The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said. Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability. This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred, to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland Revenue said. This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs, it said. In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year, it calculated. The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech. These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation. Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called "ring fence" of activities in the U.K. And its continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November, it said. Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry. He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward. Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged, he said. Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year. He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin. This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south. He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year. REUTER
trade	U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES The Administration asked Congress to replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago. Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they should pay about the same rates of duties. Yeutter said, "American exporters will find it far easier to deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of differing systems which they now face." He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule. Yeutter said government and business moves are based on data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making. He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under the new system, with about half expected to join the system by January 1988. reuter
trade	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS Japanese microchip makers are being strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market to foreign chips, industry analysts said. But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space, they said. U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said. "MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done," said Bache Securities (Japan) associate vice president Peter Wolffe. Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact's price controls. The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said. U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan. But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI's request. "NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's demands," said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. "Once NEC cuts production, it means they all have." Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact. "The best way to lower cost is to produce more," said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec. Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt Aizawa said. Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions, some industry officials said. "It's like tax avoidance schemes," said Steve Donovan, head of MMI Japan K.K. "As soon as you close one route, another opens." MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier shrugged off MITI guidance. "It's getting to be like communism," said one. But analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss. "They're going to have to start running their businesses like businesses," Bache's Wolffe said. MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry officials said response has been mixed at best. "There has been some change, but it's not across the board," said one U.S. Spokesman. "The companies have a varying degree of urgency." The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added. Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said. Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they said. Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S. Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing. Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S. Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said. "The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't even have an office here," a source close to the industry said. "You could question just how committed they are." In addition, some industry analysts question the effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third country chipmakers such as those in South Korea. "(South) Korea's gaining market share," said one analyst. "They're the real winners from the agreement." REUTER

BANKS TO RAISE PRIME RATES SOON, DEALERS SAY Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks yesterday, dealers said. They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at this weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of Banks. G.C.

Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2 pct, the level at beginning of 1987. The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong dollar, he said.

crude	WORLD BANK CHIEF PLEDGES SUPPORT TO INDONESIA World Bank president Barber Conable pledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed. Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto, he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy. Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years. Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices. "We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy," he said. He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries. Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy. However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place. Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country. REUTER
money-fx	MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY The monetary authorities of the major industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention, dealers said. The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month's Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal of the success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza meeting to weaken the dollar, they said. The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides, dealers said. Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the United States, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said. Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was no target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway. Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said. The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita, which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they noted. The situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge currency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars. "This means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand," said Koichi Miyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank. Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its record low was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday. Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again. The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus Italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said. Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris accord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S. Trade deficit, especially with Japan. Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a lower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said. The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said Tadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September. The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation, dealers said. Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand, they said. The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting April 1, dealers said. "The market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between 147 and 149 yen," one dealer said. The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen, he said. Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148 yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to 145. REUTER

interest	THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT Officials of five Thai commercial banks are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting interest rates, banking sources said. They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money market. Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates, they said. Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16 but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the sources said. Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade. Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about 40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created problems for many banks in managing their money effectively. Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth. The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion in bank deposits. Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the Thai stock market this week. The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up 4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02. Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market. Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of bank capital. If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct. Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local money market. REUTER
trade	UK MAY REVOKE JAPANESE FINANCIAL LICENSES The British government may revoke the licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London's financial City when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up Japan's markets to foreign competition, government sources said. "We can't say "yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)" but this is definitely being considered," an official said. His comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint retaliatory action with the United States against Japan. Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese trade practices. "There's a sense of urgency here now, but the emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in Japan," another government official told Reuters. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access. She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said. The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7 billion stg, official figures show. A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the U.K. Government to "coordinate action with the President of the United States, and through the Department of Trade and Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the British Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences" until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called "restrictive conditions" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC) (cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in Japan's international telecommunications market. The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament. Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the Conservative government to take firm action. Officials said another option now being considered by the U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese institutions. That could be done under the government's proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament. 58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said. The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally-binding international trade agreements. "The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment, banking and insurance," one official said. "This point has been made to the Japanese at official level a number times," the official added. Britain and France are now working together to urge that the European Community take collective action against Japan, but by working within EC treaties, another official said. British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio interview that the European Community should build barriers against Japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing European exporters in Japan. "There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer," he said, adding "(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight." Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade "strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness." The situation is only likely to worsen following news that Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said. But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate. Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange. In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States. There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the move could come today or early next week. Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors. REUTER

coffee	PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world"s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers "want to have the ball only in their court and it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either, they said. REUTER
crude	HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY CALL FOR OIL TAX BENEFITS Energy Secretary John Herrington said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels per day. The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day. Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints. Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce. He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security. Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy. He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one mln barrels a day. The report said that by the end of the century the United States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil consumption, posing a serious economic and national security threat. Reuter

sugar	SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT TO STOP IMPORTING SUGAR The Food Department will no longer import sugar from April 1, senior officials of the Food and Cooperatives Ministry and the Department told Reuters. They said the decision was taken after the Sugar Importers Association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised. "The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will no longer hold a buffer stock," a senior official said. He said the government has finalised an agreement with E.D.F.Man (Sugar) Ltd under which E.D.F.Man will hold a buffer stock on the government's behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the 45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department. Officials said the size of the buffer stock has been reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks. The agreement with E.D.F. Man includes details such as trigger pricing mechanisms, they said. Four months ago the Department allowed the private sector to import sugar without government clearance. The Department and the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes of sugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes. An Importers Association official said that "even if the Department no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarily buy more." This is because the Association would still have to compete with the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE), he said. The CWE is a semi-government body and the official said arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, starting April 1. Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar or buy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E.D.F. For the past two years. REUTER
crude	MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels, industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices. "If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price," one Japanese refiner said. "We don't intend to put pressure on them," he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend. One Japanese refiner said, "At the moment there's a lot of pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their ability." Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, "Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices." He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude. A Japanese refiner said, "The European and U.S. Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky."
money-fx	ZAMBIA, IMF TALKS HIT PROBLEMS OVER FOOD SUBSIDIES Zambia's talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an official newspaper said. The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction. The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart. According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude its talks with the government on schedule on March 23. The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its talks with the government have taken longer than expected. REUTER

The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about 10 mln dlrs a year. Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from Suva for discussions about other possible measures. "We won't be reacting further until these discussions with the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held," Palmer said. The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25. Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn back from declaring a republic. Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the Commonwealth had lapsed.

Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations. Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40. "It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates," Sumita said. The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said.

crude	BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA Brazil's state-oil company, Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said. Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil. But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere. "Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage," he said. Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said. Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are "reasonably balanced." Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere," Santana added. Reuter

The imported sugar was needed because two of three sugar refineries in the province have been temporarily shut down. It arrived in the provincial capital of Ujungpandang today and will be distributed to markets in the province, the food agency official said. Indonesia used to be a sugar exporter but last year it imported 162,500 tonnes of sugar from Thailand, Angola and Brazil to bolster its depleted stocks. Indonesia's sugar cane production last year was expected to rise significantly but domestic sugar consumption has soared because of rising demand by the food processing industry, the head of the food logistics agency, Bustanil Arifin, has said. The government has forecast that sugar production in calendar 1987 would increase 30.2 pct to 2.59 mln tonnes from 1.99 mln in 1986 but industry sources doubt whether the target could be met due to persistent post-harvest handling and transport problems.
